This guide shows how to create a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) project and install the [Speech SDK](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/speech-sdk.md) for C#. The Universal Windows Platform lets you develop apps that run on any device that supports Windows 10, including PCs, Xbox, Surface Hub, and other devices.

This guide requires:

- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0) for the Windows platform. Installing this file for the first time might require a restart.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

## Create a Visual Studio project and install the Speech SDK

To create a Visual Studio project for UWP development, you need to:

- Set up Visual Studio development options.
- Create the project and select the target architecture.
- Set up audio capture.
- Install the Speech SDK.

### Set up Visual Studio development options

Make sure you're set up correctly in Visual Studio for UWP development:

1. Open Visual Studio to display the start window.

1. Select **Continue without code** to go to the Visual Studio IDE.

1. From the Visual Studio menu bar, select **Tools** > **Get Tools and Features** to open Visual Studio Installer and view the **Modifying** dialog box.

1. On the **Workloads** tab, find the **Universal Windows Platform development** workload. If that workload is already selected, close the **Modifying** dialog box and close Visual Studio Installer. Skip the rest of this procedure.

   :::image type="content" source="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-workload-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Workloads tab of the Modifying dialog box, with the workload for Universal Windows Platform development highlighted." lightbox="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-workload.png":::

1. Select **Universal Windows Platform development**, and then select **Modify**.

1. In the **Before we get started** dialog box, select **Continue** to install the UWP development workload. Installation of the new feature might take a while.

1. Close Visual Studio Installer.

### Create the project

Next, create your project and select the target architecture:

1. On the Visual Studio menu bar, select **File** > **New** > **Project** to display the **Create a new project** window.

1. Find and select **Blank App (Universal Windows)**. Make sure that you select the C# version of this project type, as opposed to Visual Basic.

1. Select **Next**.

1. In the **Configure your new project** dialog box, in **Project name**, enter *helloworld*.

1. In **Location**, go to and select or create the folder where you want to save your project.

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the **New Universal Windows Platform Project** window, in **Minimum version** (the second dropdown box), select **Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (10.0; Build 16299)**. That requirement is the minimum for the Speech SDK.

1. In **Target version** (the first dropdown box), choose a value identical to or later than the value in **Minimum version**.

1. Select **OK**. You return to the Visual Studio IDE, with the new project created and visible on the **Solution Explorer** pane.

   :::image type="content" source="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-helloworld-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the helloworld project visible in Visual Studio." lightbox="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-helloworld.png":::

1. Select your target platform architecture. On the Visual Studio toolbar, find the **Solution Platforms** dropdown box. If you don't see it, select **View** > **Toolbars** > **Standard** to display the toolbar that contains **Solution Platforms**.

   If you're running 64-bit Windows, select **x64** in the drop-down box. 64-bit Windows can also run 32-bit applications, so you can choose **x86** if you prefer.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Speech SDK supports all Intel-compatible processors, but *only x64* versions of ARM processors.

### Set up audio capture

Allow the project to capture audio input:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, select **Package.appxmanifest** to open the package application manifest.

1. Select the **Capabilities** tab, then select the **Microphone** capability.

   :::image type="content" source="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-07-capabilities.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio that shows the Capabilities tab in the package application manifest." lightbox="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-07-capabilities.png":::

1. From the menu bar, select **File** > **Save Package.appxmanifest** to save your changes.

### Install the Speech SDK for UWP

Finally, install the [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://aka.ms/csspeech/nuget), and reference the Speech SDK in your project:

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your solution, and select **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution** to go to the **NuGet - Solution** window.

1. Select **Browse**. In **Package source**, select **nuget.org**.

   :::image type="content" source="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-nuget-solution-browse.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Manage Packages for Solution dialog box, with the Browse tab, search box, and package source highlighted." lightbox="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/vs-enable-uwp-nuget-solution-browse.png":::

1. In the **Search** box, enter *Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech*. Choose that package after it appears in the search results.

1. In the package status pane next to the search results, select your **helloworld** project.

1. Select **Install**.

   :::image type="content" source="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-05-nuget-install-1.0.0-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech package selected, with the project and the Install button highlighted." lightbox="~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/media/sdk/qs-csharp-uwp-05-nuget-install-1.0.0.png":::

1. In the **Preview Changes** dialog box, select **Apply**.

1. In the **License Acceptance** dialog box, view the license, and then select **I Accept**. The package installation begins.

   When installation is complete, the **Output** pane displays a message that's similar to the following text: `Successfully installed 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech 1.15.0' to helloworld`.
