The Speech SDK for Python is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

On Windows, you must use the 64-bit target architecture. Windows 10 or later is required.

Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170&preserve-view=true) for your platform. Installing this package for the first time might require a restart.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that packages of the same target architecture are installed. For example, if you install the x64 redistributable package, install the x64 Python package.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

> [!CAUTION]
> This article references CentOS, a Linux distribution that is nearing End Of Life (EOL) status. Please consider your use and planning accordingly.

The Speech SDK for Python supports the following distributions on the x64 and ARM64 architectures:

- Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04
- Debian 10/11
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8
- CentOS 8

[!INCLUDE [Linux distributions](linux-distributions.md)]

# [macOS](#tab/macos)

A macOS version 10.14 or later is required.

Install a version of [Python from 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- To check your installation, open a terminal and run the command `python --version`. If Python installed properly, you get a response like `Python 3.8.10`.

- If you're using macOS or Linux, you might need to run the command `python3 --version` instead.

  To enable use of `python` instead of `python3`, run `alias python='python3'` to set up an alias. The Speech SDK quickstart samples specify `python` usage.
