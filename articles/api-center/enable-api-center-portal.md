# Enable your API Center portal

This article shows how to enable your *API Center portal*, an automatically generated website that developers and other stakeholders in your organization can use to discover the APIs in your [API center](overview.md). The portal is hosted by Azure at a unique URL and restricts user access based on Azure role-based access control.

## Prerequisites

* An API center in your Azure subscription. If you haven't created one already, see [Quickstart: Create your API center](set-up-api-center.md).

* Permissions to create an app registration in a Microsoft Entra tenant associated with your Azure subscription, and permissions to grant access to data in your API center. 

## Create Microsoft Entra app registration

First configure an app registration in your Microsoft Entra ID tenant. The app registration enables the API Center portal to access data from your API center on behalf of a signed-in user.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**.
1. Select **+ New registration**. 
1. On the **Register an application** page, set the values as follows:
    
    * Set **Name** to a meaningful name such as *api-center-portal*
    * Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory (Single tenant)**. 
    * In **Redirect URI**, select **Single-page application (SPA)** and enter the following URI, substituting your API center name and region where indicated:

        `https://<api-center-name>.portal.<region>.azure-apicenter.ms`

        Example: `https://contoso.portal.westeurope.azure-apicenter.ms`

    * Select **Register**.
1. On the **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value when you configure the identity provider for the portal in your API center.
      
1. On the **API permissions** page, select **+ Add a permission**. 
    1. On the **Request API permissions** page, select the **APIs my organization uses** tab. Search for and select **Azure API Center**. You can also search for and select application ID `c3ca1a77-7a87-4dba-b8f8-eea115ae4573`. 
    1. On the **Request permissions** page, select **user_impersonation**.
    1. Select **Add permissions**. 

    The Azure API Center permissions appear under **Configured permissions**.

## Configure Microsoft Entra ID provider for API Center portal

In your API center, configure the Microsoft Entra ID identity provider for the API Center portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. In the left menu, under **API Center portal**, select **Portal settings**.
1. Select **Identity provider** > **Start set up**.
1. On the **Set up user sign-in with Microsoft Entra ID** page, in **Client ID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** of the app registration that you created in the previous section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-center-portal/set-up-sign-in-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Entra ID provider settings in the API Center portal." lightbox="media/enable-api-center-portal/set-up-sign-in-portal.png":::

1. Select **Save + publish**. The Microsoft Entra ID provider appears on the **Identity provider** page.

1. To view the API Center portal, on the **Portal settings** page, select **View API Center portal**.

The portal is published at the following URL that you can share with developers in your organization: `https://<api-center-name>.<region>.azure-apicenter.ms`.

## Customize portal name

By default, the name that appears on the upper left of the API Center portal is the name of your API center. You can customize this name.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Portal settings** > **Site profile** page.
1. Enter a new name in **Add a website name**.
1. Select **Save + publish**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/enable-api-center-portal/add-website-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding a custom website name in the Azure portal.":::

    The new name appears after you refresh the API Center portal.

## Enable sign-in to portal by Microsoft Entra users and groups 

While the portal URL is publicly accessible, users must sign in to see the APIs in your API center. To enable sign-in, assign the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role to users or groups in your organization, scoped to your API center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, you and other administrators of the API center don't have access to APIs in the API Center portal. Be sure to assign the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role to yourself and other administrators.  

For detailed prerequisites and steps to assign a role to users and groups, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md). Brief steps follow:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API center.
1. In the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add role assignment**.
1. In the **Add role assignment** pane, set the values as follows:
    * On the **Role** page, search for and select **Azure API Center Data Reader**. Select **Next**.
    * On the **Members** page, In **Assign access to**, select **User, group, or service principal** > **+ Select members**.
    * On the **Select members** page, search for and select the users or groups to assign the role to. Click **Select** and then **Next**.
    * Review the role assignment, and select **Review + assign**.

> [!NOTE]
> To streamline access configuration for new users, we recommend that you assign the role to a Microsoft Entra group and configure a dynamic group membership rule. To learn more, see [Create or update a dynamic group in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity/users/groups-create-rule).

After you configure access to the portal, configured users can sign in to the portal and view the APIs in your API center.

> [!NOTE]
> The first user to sign in to the portal is prompted to consent to the permissions requested by the API Center portal app registration. Thereafter, other configured users aren't prompted to consent.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "You are not authorized to access this portal"

Under certain conditions, a user might encounter the following error message after signing into the API Center portal with a configured user account:

`You are not authorized to access this portal. Please contact your portal administrator for assistance.`
`

First, confirm that the user is assigned the **Azure API Center Data Reader** role in your API center.

If the user is assigned the role, there might be a problem with the registration of the **Microsoft.ApiCenter** resource provider in your subscription, and you might need to re-register the resource provider. To do this, run the following command in the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ApiCenter
```

### Unable to select Azure API Center permissions in Microsoft Entra app registration

If you're unable to request API permissions to Azure API Center in your Microsoft Entra app registration for the API Center portal, check that you are searching for **Azure API Center** (or application ID `c3ca1a77-7a87-4dba-b8f8-eea115ae4573`). 

If the app isn't present, there might be a problem with the registration of the **Microsoft.ApiCenter** resource provider in your subscription. You might need to re-register the resource provider. To do this, run the following command in the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ApiCenter
```

After re-registering the resource provider, try again to request API permissions.
