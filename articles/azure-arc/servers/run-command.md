# Remotely and securely configure servers using Run command (Preview)

Run Command on Azure Arc-enabled servers (Public Preview) uses the Connected Machine agent to let you remotely and securely run a script inside your servers. This can be helpful for myriad scenarios across troubleshooting, recovery, diagnostics, and maintenance.

## Supported environment and configuration

- **Experiences:** Run Command is currently supported through Azure CLI and PowerShell. 

- **Operating Systems:** Run Command supports both Windows and Linux operating systems. 

- **Environments:** Run Command supports non-Azure environments including on-premises, VMware, SCVMM, AWS, GCP, and OCI.  

- **Cost:** Run Command is free of charge, however storage of scripts in Azure may incur billing.

- **Configuration:** Run Command doesn't require more configuration or the deployment of any extensions. The
Connected Machine agent version must be 1.33 or higher. 


## Limiting access to Run Command using RBAC

Listing the run commands or showing details of a command requires the `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/runCommands/read` permission. The built-in [Reader](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) role and higher levels have this permission.

Running a command requires the `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/runCommands/write` permission. The [Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) role and higher levels have this permission.

You can use one of the [built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) or create a [custom role](/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) to use Run Command.

## Blocking run commands locally

The Connected Machine agent supports local configurations that allow you to set an allowlist or a blocklist. See [Extension allowlists and blocklists](security-overview.md#extension-allowlists-and-blocklists) to learn more.

For Windows:

`azcmagent config set extensions.blocklist "microsoft.cplat.core/runcommandhandlerwindows"`

For Linux:

`azcmagent config set extensions.blocklist "microsoft.cplat.core/runcommandhandlerlinux"`


## Azure CLI

The following examples use [az connectedmachine run-command](/cli/azure/connectedmachine/run-command) to run a shell script on an Azure Windows machine.

### Execute a script with the machine

This command delivers the script to the machine, executes it, and returns the captured output.

```azurecli
az connectedmachine run-command create –-name "myRunCommand" --machine-name "myMachine" --resource-group "myRG" --script "Write-Host Hello World!"
```

### List all deployed RunCommand resources on a machine

This command returns a full list of previously deployed run commands along with their properties.

```azurecli
az connectedmachine run-command list --machine-name "myMachine" --resource-group "myRG"
```

### Get execution status and results

This command retrieves current execution progress, including latest output, start/end time, exit code, and terminal state of the execution.

```azurecli
az connectedmachine run-command show --name "myRunCommand" --machine-name "myMachine" --resource-group "myRG"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Output and error fields in `instanceView` is limited to the last 4KB. To access the full output and error, you can forward the output and error data to storage append blobs using `-outputBlobUri` and `-errorBlobUri` parameters while executing Run Command.
> 

### Delete RunCommand resource from the machine

Remove the RunCommand resource previously deployed on the machine. If the script execution is still in progress, execution will be terminated.

```azurecli
az connectedmachine run-command delete --name "myRunCommand" --machine-name "myMachine" --resource-group "myRG"
```

## PowerShell

### Execute a script with the machine

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -MachineName "myMachine" -Location "EastUS" -RunCommandName "RunCommandName" –SourceScript "echo Hello World!"
```

### Execute a script on the machine using SourceScriptUri parameter

`OutputBlobUri` and `ErrorBlobUri` are optional parameters.

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName -MachineName -RunCommandName -SourceScriptUri “< SAS URI of a storage blob with read access or public URI>” -OutputBlobUri “< SAS URI of a storage append blob with read, add, create, write access>” -ErrorBlobUri “< SAS URI of a storage append blob with read, add, create, write access>”
```

### List all deployed RunCommand resources on a machine

This command returns a full list of previously deployed Run Commands along with their properties.

```powershell
Get-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -MachineName "myMachine"
```

### Get execution status and results

This command retrieves current execution progress, including latest output, start/end time, exit code, and terminal state of the execution.

```powershell
Get-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName "myRG" - MachineName "myMachine" -RunCommandName "RunCommandName"
```

### Create or update Run Command on a machine using SourceScriptUri (storage blob SAS URL)

Create or update Run Command on a Windows machine using a SAS URL of a storage blob that contains a PowerShell script. `SourceScriptUri` can be a storage blob’s full SAS URL or public URL.

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG0 -MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand -Location EastUS2EUAP -SourceScriptUri <SourceScriptUri>
```

> [!NOTE]
> SAS URL must provide read access to the blob. An expiration time of 24 hours is suggested for SAS URL. SAS URLs can be generated on the Azure portal using blob options, or SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`. If generating SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`, your SAS URL = "base blob URL" + "?" + "SAS token from `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`"
> 

### Get a Run Command Instance View for a machine after creating or updating Run Command

Get a Run Command for machine with Instance View. Instance View contains the execution state of run command (Succeeded, Failed, etc.), exit code, standard output, and standard error generated by executing the script using Run Command. A non-zero ExitCode indicates an unsuccessful execution.

```powershell
Get-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG -MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand
```

`InstanceViewExecutionState`: Status of user's Run Command script. Refer to this state to know whether your script was successful or not. 

`ProvisioningState`: Status of general extension provisioning end to end (whether extension platform was able to trigger Run Command script or not).

### Create or update Run Command on a machine using SourceScript (script text)

Create or update Run Command on a machine passing the script content directly to `-SourceScript` parameter. Use `;` to separate multiple commands.

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG0 -MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand2 -Location EastUS2EUAP -SourceScript "id; echo HelloWorld"
```

### Create or update Run Command on a machine using OutputBlobUri, ErrorBlobUri to stream standard output and standard error messages to output and error Append blobs

Create or update Run Command on a machine and stream standard output and standard error messages to output and error Append blobs.

```powershell
New-AzConnectedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG0 - MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand3 -Location EastUS2EUAP -SourceScript "id; echo HelloWorld"-OutputBlobUri <OutPutBlobUrI> -ErrorBlobUri <ErrorBlobUri>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Output and error blobs must be the AppendBlob type and their SAS URLs must provide read, append, create, write access to the blob. An expiration time of 24 hours is suggested for SAS URL. If output or error blob does not exist, a blob of type AppendBlob will be created. SAS URLs can be generated on Azure portal using blob's options, or SAS token from using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`.
> 

### Create or update Run Command on a machine as a different user using RunAsUser and RunAsPassword parameters

Create or update Run Command on a machine as a different user using `RunAsUser` and `RunAsPassword` parameters. For RunAs to work properly, contact the administrator the of machine and make sure user is added on the machine, user has access to resources accessed by the Run Command (directories, files, network etc.), and in case of Windows machine, 'Secondary Logon' service is running on the machine.

```powershell
New-AzMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG0 -MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand -Location EastUS2EUAP -SourceScript "id; echo HelloWorld" -RunAsUser myusername -RunAsPassword mypassword
```

### Create or update Run Command on a machine resource using SourceScriptUri (storage blob SAS URL)

Create or update Run Command on a Windows machine resource using a SAS URL of a storage blob that contains a PowerShell script.


```powershell
New-AzMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName MyRG0 -MachineName MyMachine -RunCommandName MyRunCommand -Location EastUS2EUAP -SourceScriptUri <SourceScriptUri>
```

> [!NOTE]
> SAS URL must provide read access to the blob. An expiry time of 24 hours is suggested for SAS URL. SAS URLs can be generated on Azure portal using blob options or SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`. If generating SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`, the SAS URL format is: base blob URL + "?" + the SAS token from `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`.
> 

### Create or update Run Command on a machine instance using Parameter and ProtectedParameter parameters (Public and Protected Parameters to script)

Use ProtectedParameter to pass any sensitive inputs to script such as passwords, keys etc.

- Windows: Parameters and ProtectedParameters are passed to script as arguments are passed to script and run like this: `myscript.ps1 -publicParam1 publicParam1value -publicParam2 publicParam2value -secret1 secret1value -secret2 secret2value`

- Linux: Named Parameters and its values are set to environment config, which should be accessible within the .sh script. For Nameless arguments, pass an empty string to name input. Nameless arguments are passed to script and run like this: `myscript.sh publicParam1value publicParam2value secret1value secret2value`

### Delete RunCommand resource from the machine

Remove the RunCommand resource previously deployed on the machine. If the script execution is still in progress, execution will be terminated.

```powershell
Remove-AzConnetedMachineRunCommand -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -MachineName "myMachine" -RunCommandName "RunCommandName"
```

## Run Command operations

Run Command on Azure Arc-enabled servers supports the following operations:

|Operation  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|[Create](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machine-run-commands/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP) |The operation to create a run command. This runs the run command. |
|[Delete](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machine-run-commands/delete?tabs=HTTP) |The operation to delete a run command. If it's running, delete will also stop the run command. |
|[Get](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machine-run-commands/get?tabs=HTTP) |The operation to get a run command. |
|[List](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machine-run-commands/list?tabs=HTTP) |The operation to get all the run commands of an Azure Arc-enabled server. |
|[Update](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machine-run-commands/update?tabs=HTTP) |The operation to update the run command. This stops the previous run command. |
 
> [!NOTE]
> Output and error blobs are overwritten each time the run command script executes.
> 

## Example scenarios

Suppose you have an Azure Arc-enabled server called “2012DatacenterServer1” in resource group “ContosoRG” with Subscription ID “aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa”. Consider a scenario where you need to provide remote access to an endpoint for Windows Server 2012 / R2 servers. Access to Extended Security Updates enabled by Azure Arc requires access to the endpoint `www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs`. You need to remotely configure a firewall rule that allows access to this endpoint. Use Run Command in order to allow connectivity to this endpoint.

### Example 1: Endpoint access with Run Command

Start off by creating a Run Command script to provide endpoint access to the `www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs` endpoint on your target Arc-enabled server using the PUT operation.

To directly provide the script in line, use the following operation:

```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/EndpointAccessCommand?api-version=2023-10-03-preview

{
  "location": "eastus2",
  "properties": {
    "source": {
      "script": " New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName $ruleName -Direction Outbound -Action Allow -RemoteAddress $endpoint -RemotePort $port -Protocol $protocol”
    },
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "ruleName",
        "value": " Allow access to www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs"
      },
      {
        "name": "endpoint",
        "value": "www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs"
      },
      {
        "name": "port",
        "value": 433
      },
      {
        "name": "protocol",
        "value": "TCP"
      }

    ],
    "asyncExecution": false,
    "runAsUser": "contoso-user1",
    "runAsPassword": "Contoso123!”
    "timeoutInSeconds": 3600,
    "outputBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscriptoutputcontainer/MyScriptoutput.txt",
    "errorBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/MyScriptError.txt"
  }
}
```

To instead link to the script file, you can use the Run Command operation’s ScriptURI option. For this it's assumed you have prepared a `newnetfirewallrule.ps1` file containing the in-line script and uploaded this script to blob storage.

```
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/EndpointAccessCommand?api-version=2023-10-03-preview

{
  "location": "eastus2",
  "properties": {
    "source": {
      "scriptUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscriptoutputcontainer/newnetfirewallrule.ps1"
    },
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "ruleName",
        "value": " Allow access to www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs"
      },
      {
        "name": "endpoint",
        "value": "www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs"
      },
      {
        "name": "port",
        "value": 433
      },
      {
        "name": "protocol",
        "value": "TCP"
      }

    ],
    "asyncExecution": false,
    "runAsUser": "contoso-user1",
    "runAsPassword": "Contoso123!”
    "timeoutInSeconds": 3600,
    "outputBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscriptoutputcontainer/MyScriptoutput.txt",
    "errorBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/MyScriptError.txt"
  }
}
```

SAS URL must provide read access to the blob. An expiry time of 24 hours is suggested for SAS URL. SAS URLs can be generated on Azure portal using blobs options or SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`. If generating SAS token using `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`, the SAS URL format is: `base blob URL + "?"` + the SAS token from `New-AzStorageBlobSASToken`. 

Output and error blobs must be the AppendBlob type and their SAS URLs must provide read, append, create, write access to the blob. An expiration time of 24 hours is suggested for SAS URL. SAS URLs can be generated on Azure portal using blob's options, or SAS token from using New-`AzStorageBlobSASToken`.

### Example 2: Get Run Command details

To verify that you've correctly provisioned the Run Command, use the GET command to retrieve details on the provisioned Run Command:

```
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/EndpointAccessCommand?api-version=2023-10-03-preview
```

### Example 3: Update the Run Command

Let’s suppose you want to open up access to an additional endpoint `*.waconazure.com` for connectivity to Windows Admin Center. You can update the existing Run Command with new parameters:


```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/EndpointAccessCommand?api-version=2023-10-03-preview

{
  "location": "eastus2",
  "properties": {
    "source": {
      "script": " New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName $ruleName -Direction Outbound -Action Allow -RemoteAddress $endpoint -RemotePort $port -Protocol $protocol”
    },
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "ruleName",
        "value": " Allow access to WAC endpoint"
      },
      {
        "name": "endpoint",
        "value": “*.waconazure.com”
      },
      {
        "name": "port",
        "value": 433
      },
      {
        "name": "protocol",
        "value": "TCP"
      }
    ],
    "asyncExecution": false,
    "runAsUser": "contoso-user1",
    "runAsPassword": "Contoso123!",
    "timeoutInSeconds": 3600,
    "outputBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myscriptoutputcontainer/MyScriptoutput.txt",
    "errorBlobUri": "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/MyScriptError.txt"
  }
}
```


### Example 4: List Run Commands

Ahead of deleting the Run Command for Endpoint Access, make sure there are no other Run Commands for the Arc-enabled server. You can use the list command to get all of the Run Commands:

```
LIST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/
```

### Example 5: Delete a Run Command

If you no longer need the Run Command extension, you can delete it using the following command:

```
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/ aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa/resourceGroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/2012DatacenterServer1/runCommands/EndpointAccessCommand?api-version=2023-10-03-preview
```

## Disabling Run Command

To disable the Run Command on Azure Arc-enabled servers, open an administrative command prompt and run the following commands. These commands use the local agent configuration capabilities for the Connected Machine agent in the Extension blocklist.

**Windows**

`azcmagent config set extensions.blocklist "microsoft.cplat.core/runcommandhandlerwindows"`

**Linux**

`sudo azcmagent config set extensions.blocklist "microsoft.cplat.core/runcommandhandlerlinux"`
