# Enable Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry for .NET, Node.js, Python and Java applications

This article describes how to enable and configure OpenTelemetry-based data collection to power the experiences within [Azure Monitor Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md#application-insights-overview). We walk through how to install the "Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro." The Distro [automatically collects](opentelemetry-add-modify.md#automatic-data-collection) traces, metrics, logs, and exceptions across your application and its dependencies. To learn more about collecting data using OpenTelemetry, see [Data Collection Basics](opentelemetry-overview.md) or [OpenTelemetry FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions).

## OpenTelemetry Release Status

OpenTelemetry offerings are available for .NET, Node.js, Python and Java applications.

> [!NOTE]
> For a feature-by-feature release status, see the [FAQ](#whats-the-current-release-state-of-features-within-the-azure-monitor-opentelemetry-distro).

### Enable Azure Monitor Application Insights

To enable Azure Monitor Application Insights, you make a minor modification to your application and set your "Connection String." The Connection String tells your application where to send the telemetry the Distro collects, and it's unique to you.

#### Modify your Application

##### [ASP.NET Core](#tab/aspnetcore)

Add `UseAzureMonitor()` to your application startup. This is in your `program.cs` class.

```csharp
// Import the Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore namespace.
using Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore;

// Create a new WebApplicationBuilder instance.
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add OpenTelemetry and configure it to use Azure Monitor.
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry().UseAzureMonitor();

// Build the application.
var app = builder.Build();

// Run the application.
app.Run();
```

##### [.NET](#tab/net)

Add the Azure Monitor Exporter to each OpenTelemetry signal in application startup. Depending on your version of .NET, it is in either your `startup.cs` or `program.cs` class.

```csharp
// Create a new tracer provider builder and add an Azure Monitor trace exporter to the tracer provider builder.
// It is important to keep the TracerProvider instance active throughout the process lifetime.
// See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/docs/trace#tracerprovider-management
var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddAzureMonitorTraceExporter();

// Add an Azure Monitor metric exporter to the metrics provider builder.
// It is important to keep the MetricsProvider instance active throughout the process lifetime.
// See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/docs/metrics#meterprovider-management
var metricsProvider = Sdk.CreateMeterProviderBuilder()
    .AddAzureMonitorMetricExporter();

// Create a new logger factory.
// It is important to keep the LoggerFactory instance active throughout the process lifetime.
// See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main/docs/logs#logger-management
var loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder =>
{
    builder.AddOpenTelemetry(options =>
    {
        options.AddAzureMonitorLogExporter();
    });
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see the [getting-started tutorial for OpenTelemetry .NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/tree/main#getting-started)

##### [Java](#tab/java)

Java autoinstrumentation is enabled through configuration changes; no code changes are required.

Point the JVM to the jar file by adding `-javaagent:"path/to/applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar"` to your application's JVM args.

> [!TIP]
> Sampling is enabled by default at a rate of 5 requests per second, aiding in cost management. Telemetry data may be missing in scenarios exceeding this rate. For more information on modifying sampling configuration, see [sampling overrides](./java-standalone-sampling-overrides.md).

> [!TIP]
> For scenario-specific guidance, see [Get Started (Supplemental)](./java-get-started-supplemental.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you develop a Spring Boot application, you can optionally replace the JVM argument by a programmatic configuration. For more information, see [Using Azure Monitor Application Insights with Spring Boot](./java-spring-boot.md).

##### [Node.js](#tab/nodejs)

```typescript
// Import the `useAzureMonitor()` function from the `@azure/monitor-opentelemetry` package.
const { useAzureMonitor } = require("@azure/monitor-opentelemetry");

// Call the `useAzureMonitor()` function to configure OpenTelemetry to use Azure Monitor.
useAzureMonitor();
```

##### [Python](#tab/python)

```python
# Import the `configure_azure_monitor()` function from the
# `azure.monitor.opentelemetry` package.
from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure_azure_monitor

# Import the tracing api from the `opentelemetry` package.
from opentelemetry import trace

# Configure OpenTelemetry to use Azure Monitor with the specified connection
# string.
configure_azure_monitor(
    connection_string="<Your Connection String>",
)

# Get a tracer for the current module.
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Start a new span with the name "hello". This also sets this created span as the current span in this context. This span will be exported to Azure Monitor as part of the trace.
with tracer.start_as_current_span("hello"):
    print("Hello, World!")

# Wait for export to take place in the background.
input()

```

#### Copy the Connection String from your Application Insights Resource

> [!TIP]
> If you don't already have one, now is a great time to [Create an Application Insights Resource](create-workspace-resource.md#create-a-workspace-based-resource). Here's when we recommend you [create a new Application Insights Resource versus use an existing one](create-workspace-resource.md#when-to-use-a-single-application-insights-resource).

To copy your unique Connection String:

:::image type="content" source="media/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Application Insights overview and connection string." lightbox="media/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings/migrate-from-instrumentation-keys-to-connection-strings.png":::

1. Go to the **Overview** pane of your Application Insights resource.
2. Find your **Connection String**.
3. Hover over the connection string and select the **Copy to clipboard** icon.

#### Paste the Connection String in your environment

To paste your Connection String, select from the following options:

  A. Set via Environment Variable (Recommended)
  
  Replace `<Your Connection String>` in the following command with *your* unique connection string.

   ```console
   APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=<Your Connection String>
   ```

  B. Set via Configuration File - Java Only (Recommended)
  
  Create a configuration file named `applicationinsights.json`, and place it in the same directory as `applicationinsights-agent-3.4.19.jar` with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "connectionString": "<Your Connection String>"
   }
   ```

  Replace `<Your Connection String>` in the preceding JSON with *your* unique connection string.

  C. Set via Code - ASP.NET Core, Node.js, and Python Only (Not recommended)
  
  See [Connection String Configuration](opentelemetry-configuration.md#connection-string) for an example of setting Connection String via code.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you set the connection string in more than one place, we adhere to the following precedence:
  >
  > 1. Code
  > 2. Environment Variable
  > 3. Configuration File

#### Confirm data is flowing

Run your application and open your **Application Insights Resource** tab in the Azure portal. It might take a few minutes for data to show up in the portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/opentelemetry/server-requests.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Application Insights Overview tab with server requests and server response time highlighted.":::

Application Insights is now enabled for your application. All the following steps are optional and allow for further customization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have two or more services that emit telemetry to the same Application Insights resource, you're required to [set Cloud Role Names](opentelemetry-configuration.md#set-the-cloud-role-name-and-the-cloud-role-instance) to represent them properly on the Application Map.

As part of using Application Insights instrumentation, we collect and send diagnostic data to Microsoft. This data helps us run and improve Application Insights. To learn more, see [Statsbeat in Azure Application Insights](./statsbeat.md).
