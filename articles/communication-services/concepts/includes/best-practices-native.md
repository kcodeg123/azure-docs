## Azure Communication Services native SDK best practices

This section provides information about best practices associated with the Azure Communication Services voice and video calling native SDK.

## Supported platforms

Here are the minimum OS platform requirements to ensure optimal functionality of the Calling Native SDKs.

### [iOS](#tab/ios)

- Support for iOS 10.0+ at build time, and iOS 12.0+ at run time.
- Xcode 12.0+.
- Support for **iPadOS** 13.0+.

### [Android](#tab/android)

- Support for Android API Level 21 or Higher.
- Support for Java 7 or higher.
- Support for Android Studio 2.0.
- **Android Auto** and **IoT devices running Android** are currently not supported.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

- Support for UWP (Universal Windows Platform).
- Support for WinUI 3.

## App request device permissions

To use the Calling Native SDKs for making or receiving calls, it's necessary to authorize each platform to access device resources. As a developer, you should prompt the user for access and ensure that it's enabled. The consumer authorizes these access rights, so verify that they have been granted permission previously.

### [iOS](#tab/ios)

- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` for microphone access.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` for camera access.

### [Android](#tab/android)

In the Application Manifest (`app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`). Verify the following lines:

```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE" />
```

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

Go to `Package.appxmanifest` and select capabilities:

- `Internet (Client)` & `Internet (Client & Server)` for network access.
- `Microphone` to access the audio feed of the microphone.
- `Webcam` to access the video feed of the camera.

## Configure the logs

Implementing **logging** as per the [logs file retrieval tutorial](../../tutorials/log-file-retrieval-tutorial.md) is more critical than ever. Detailed logs help in diagnosing issues specific to device models or OS versions that meet the minimum SDK criteria. We encourage to the developers that start configuring the Logs API without the logs the Microsoft Support team **won't be able** to help debug and troubleshoot the calls.

## Track Call ID

**`CallID`** is the unique ID for a call. It identifies correlated events from all of the participants and endpoints that connect during a single call, in Most cases you use it to review the logs and  Microsoft Support team ask for it to help troubleshoot the calls. You **should** track the `CallID` in your telemetry that you configure in your app, you can follow the guidelines in the [troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting-info.md) to understand how to retrieve it for each platform.

## Subscribe to UFD (User Facing Diagnostics) and media quality statistics

- [User Facing Diagnostics (UFD)](../voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md) that can be used to examine various properties of a call to determine what the issue might be during the call that affects your customers.
- [Media quality statistics](../voice-video-calling/media-quality-sdk.md) examine the low-level audio, video, and screen-sharing quality metrics for incoming and outgoing call metrics. We recommend that you collect the data and send it to your pipeline ingestion after your call ends.

## Error Handling

If there are any errors during the call or implementation, the methods return error objects containing error codes. It's crucial to use these error objects for proper error handling and to display alerts. The call states also return error codes to help identify the reason behind call failure. You can refer to [the troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting-info.md), to resolve any issues.

### Managing Video Streams

Make sure to dispose of the `VideoStreamRendererView` when the video is no longer displayed on the UI. Use `VideoStreamType` to determine the type of the stream.

## General memory management

**Preallocate Resources**. Initialize your calling client and any necessary resources during your app's startup phase rather than on demand. This approach reduces latency when starting a call.

**Dispose Properly**. Ensure that all call objects are correctly disposed of after use to free up system resources and avoid memory leaks. Make sure to unsubscribe from *events* preventing memory leaks.

## Camera or microphone being used by another process

It's important to note that on mobile devices if multiple processes try to access the camera or microphone at the same time, the first process to request access will take control of the device. As a result, the second process will immediately lose access to it.
