# Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL Java SDK (legacy): Release notes and resources

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

[!INCLUDE[SDK selector](../includes/cosmos-db-sdk-list.md)]

This article covers the Azure Cosmos DB Sync Java SDK v2 for the API for NoSQL. This API only supports synchronous operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is *not* the latest Java SDK for Azure Cosmos DB! We **strongly recommend** using [Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](sdk-java-v4.md) for your project. To upgrade, follow the instructions in the [Migrate to Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4](migrate-java-v4-sdk.md) guide and the [Reactor vs RxJava](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-java-sql-api-samples/blob/main/reactor-rxjava-guide.md) guide.

> [!WARNING]  
> On February 29, 2024 the Azure Cosmos DB Sync Java SDK v2.x will be retired. Azure Cosmos DB will cease to provide further maintenance and support for this SDK after retirement. Please follow the instructions here to migrate to Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK v4.

## Release and retirement dates

Microsoft provides notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version. New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK. We recommend that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible.

> [!WARNING]
> After 30 might 2020, Azure Cosmos DB will no longer make bug fixes, add new features, and provide support to versions 1.x of the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK for API for NoSQL. If you prefer not to upgrade, requests sent from version 1.x of the SDK will continue to be served by the Azure Cosmos DB service.
>
> After 29 February 2016, Azure Cosmos DB will no longer make bug fixes, add new features, and provide support to versions 0.x of the Azure Cosmos DB Java SDK for API for NoSQL. If you prefer not to upgrade, requests sent from version 0.x of the SDK will continue to be served by the Azure Cosmos DB service.
