# Transition to Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management for servers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Defender for Server's vulnerability assessment solution powered by Qualys, is on a retirement path that is set to complete on **May 1st, 2024**. If you are a currently using the built-in vulnerability assessment powered by Qualys, you should plan to transition to the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management vulnerability scanning using the steps on this page.

> Customers who want to continue using Qualys, can do so with the [Bring Your Own License (BYOL) method](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md).

With the Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can scan compute assets for vulnerabilities. If you're currently using a vulnerability assessment solution other than the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management vulnerability assessment solution, this article provides instructions on transitioning to the integrated Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

To transition to the integrated Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you can use the Azure portal, use an Azure policy definition (for Azure VMs), or use REST APIs.

- [Transition with Defender for Cloud’s portal](#transition-with-defender-for-clouds-portal)
- [Transition with REST API](#transition-with-rest-api)

## Transition with Azure policy (for Azure VMs) 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Policy** > **Definitions**.

1. Search for `Setup subscriptions to transition to an alternative vulnerability assessment solution`. 

1. Select **Assign**.

1. Select a scope and enter an assignment name.

1. Select **Review + create**.

1. Review the information you entered and select **Create**.
 
This policy ensures that all Virtual Machines (VM) within a selected subscription are safeguarded with the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

Once you complete the transition to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you need to [Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution](#remove-the-old-vulnerability-assessment-solution)

## Transition with Defender for Cloud’s portal 

In the Defender for Cloud portal, you have the ability to change the vulnerability assessment solution to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings** 

1. Select the relevant subscription.

1. Locate the Defender for Servers plan and select **Settings**.

1. Toggle `Vulnerability assessment for machines` to **On**.

    If `Vulnerability assessment for machines` was already set to on, select **Edit configuration**

1. Select **Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management**.

1. Select **Apply**. 

1. Ensure that `Endpoint protection` or `Agentless scanning for machines` are toggled to **On**.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select **Save**.

Once you complete the transition to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you need to [Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution](#remove-the-old-vulnerability-assessment-solution)

## Transition with REST API

### REST API for Azure VMs

Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

`PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/serverVulnerabilityAssessmentsSettings/AzureServersSetting?api-version=2022-01-01-preview`

```json
{
   "kind": "AzureServersSetting",
   "properties": {
    "selectedProvider": "MdeTvm"
   }
 }
```

Once you complete the transition to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution, you need to [Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution](#remove-the-old-vulnerability-assessment-solution)

### REST API for multicloud VMs

Using this REST API, you can easily migrate your subscription, at scale, from any vulnerability assessment solution to the Defender Vulnerability Management solution.

`PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/securityconnectors/{connectorName}?api-version=2022-08-01-preview`

```json
{
  "properties": {
   "hierarchyIdentifier": "{GcpProjectNumber}",
   "environmentName": "GCP",
   "offerings": [
​    {
​     "offeringType": "CspmMonitorGcp",
​     "nativeCloudConnection": {
​      "workloadIdentityProviderId": "{cspm}",
​      "serviceAccountEmailAddress": "{emailAddressRemainsAsIs}"
​     }
​    },
​    {
​     "offeringType": "DefenderCspmGcp"
​    },
​    {

​     "defenderForServers": {
​      "workloadIdentityProviderId": "{defender-for-servers}",
​      "serviceAccountEmailAddress": "{emailAddressRemainsAsIs}"
​     },

​     "vaAutoProvisioning": {
​      "enabled": true,
​      "configuration": {
​       "type": "TVM"
​      }
​     },
​     "subPlan": "{P1/P2}"
​    }
   ],
   "environmentData": {

​     "workloadIdentityPoolId": "{identityPoolIdRemainsTheSame}"
​    }
   }
  },
  "location": "{connectorRegion}"
}
```

## Remove the old vulnerability assessment solution

After migrating to the built-in Defender Vulnerability Management solution in Defender for Cloud, you need to offboard each VM from their old vulnerability assessment solution using either of the following methods:

- [Delete the VM extension with PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.compute/remove-azvmextension).
- [REST API DELETE request](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machine-extensions/delete?tabs=HTTP).
