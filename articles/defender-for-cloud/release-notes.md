### New insight for active repositories in Cloud Security Explorer

January 31, 2024

A new insight for Azure DevOps repositories has been added to the Cloud Security Explorer to indicate whether repositories are active. This insight indicates that the code repository is not archived or disabled, meaning that write access to code, builds, and pull requests is still available for users. Archived and disabled repositories might be considered lower priority as the code is not typically used in active deployments.

To test out the query through Cloud Security Explorer, use [this query link](https://ms.portal.azure.com#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityGraph.ReactView/query/%7B%22type%22%3A%22securitygraphquery%22%2C%22version%22%3A2%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22source%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22datasource%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22sources%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22entity%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22source%22%3A%22azuredevopsrepository%22%7D%7D%5D%2C%22conditions%22%3A%7B%22type%22%3A%22conditiongroup%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22operator%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22conditions%22%3A%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22insights%22%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%226b8f221b-c0ce-48e3-9fbb-16f917b1c095%22%7D%7D%5D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D%7D)

### Public preview of agentless malware scanning for servers

January 16, 2024

We're announcing the release of Defender for Cloud's agentless malware detection for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances, as a new feature included in [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).

Agentless malware detection for VMs is now included in our agentless scanning platform. Agentless malware scanning utilizes [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) anti-malware engine to scan and detect malicious files. Any detected threats, trigger security alerts directly into Defender for Cloud and Defender XDR, where they can be investigated and remediated. The Agentless malware scanner complements the agent-based coverage with a second layer of threat detection with frictionless onboarding and has no effect on your machine's performance.

Learn more about [agentless malware scanning](agentless-malware-scanning.md) for servers and [agentless scanning for VMs](concept-agentless-data-collection.md).

### General availability of Defender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft Defender XDR

January 15, 2024

We're announcing the general availability (GA) of the integration between Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender XDR (formerly Microsoft 365 Defender).

The integration brings competitive cloud protection capabilities into the Security Operations Center (SOC) day-to-day. With Microsoft Defender for Cloud and the Defender XDR integration, SOC teams can discover attacks that combine detections from multiple pillars, including Cloud, Endpoint, Identity, Office 365, and more.

Learn more about [alerts and incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR](concept-integration-365.md).

### DevOps security Pull Request annotations are now enabled by default for Azure DevOps connectors

January 12, 2024

DevOps security exposes security findings as annotations in Pull Requests (PR) to help developers prevent and fix potential security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations before they enter production. As of January 12, 2024, PR annotations are now enabled by default for all new and existing Azure DevOps repositories that are connected to Defender for Cloud.

By default, PR annotations are enabled only for High severity Infrastructure as Code (IaC) findings. Customers will still need to configure Microsoft Security for DevOps (MSDO) to run in PR builds and enable the Build Validation policy for CI builds in Azure DevOps repository settings. Customers can disable the PR Annotation feature for specific repositories from within the DevOps security blade repository configuration options.

Learn more about [enabling Pull Request annotations for Azure DevOps](enable-pull-request-annotations.md#enable-pull-request-annotations-in-azure-devops).

### Recommendations released for preview: Nine new Azure security recommendations

January 4, 2024

We have added nine new Azure security recommendations aligned with the Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark. These new recommendations are currently in public preview.

|Recommendation | Description  | Severity |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [Cognitive Services accounts should have local authentication methods disabled](recommendations-reference.md#identityandaccess-recommendations) | Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Cognitive Services accounts require Azure Active Directory identities exclusively for authentication. Learn more at: <https://aka.ms/cs/auth>. (Related policy: [Cognitive Services accounts should have local authentication methods disabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f71ef260a-8f18-47b7-abcb-62d0673d94dc)). | Low |
| [Cognitive Services should use private link](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Cognitive Services, you'll reduce the potential for data leakage. Learn more about [private links](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2129800). (Related policy: [Cognitive Services should use private link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fcddd188c-4b82-4c48-a19d-ddf74ee66a01)). | Medium |
| [Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled](recommendations-reference.md#compute-recommendations) | Use encryption at host to get end-to-end encryption for your virtual machine and virtual machine scale set data. Encryption at host enables encryption at rest for your temporary disk and OS/data disk caches. Temporary and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted with platform-managed keys when encryption at host is enabled. OS/data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed key, depending on the encryption type selected on the disk. Learn more at <https://aka.ms/vm-hbe>. (Related policy: [Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2ffc4d8e41-e223-45ea-9bf5-eada37891d87)). | Medium |
| [Azure Cosmos DB should disable public network access](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that your Cosmos DB account isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your Cosmos DB account. [Learn more](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-private-endpoints#blocking-public-network-access-during-account-creation). (Related policy: [Azure Cosmos DB should disable public network access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f797b37f7-06b8-444c-b1ad-fc62867f335a)). | Medium |
| [Cosmos DB accounts should use private link](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual network to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your Cosmos DB account, data leakage risks are reduced. Learn more about [private links](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-configure-private-endpoints). (Related policy: [Cosmos DB accounts should use private link](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f58440f8a-10c5-4151-bdce-dfbaad4a20b7)). | Medium |
| [VPN gateways should use only Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for point-to-site users](recommendations-reference.md#identityandaccess-recommendations) | Disabling local authentication methods improves security by ensuring that VPN Gateways use only Azure Active Directory identities for authentication. Learn more about [Azure AD authentication](/azure/vpn-gateway/openvpn-azure-ad-tenant). (Related policy: [VPN gateways should use only Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for point-to-site users](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f21a6bc25-125e-4d13-b82d-2e19b7208ab7)). | Medium |
| [Azure SQL Database should be running TLS version 1.2 or newer](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Setting TLS version to 1.2 or newer improves security by ensuring your Azure SQL Database can only be accessed from clients using TLS 1.2 or newer. Using versions of TLS less than 1.2 is not recommended since they have well documented security vulnerabilities. (Related policy: [Azure SQL Database should be running TLS version 1.2 or newer](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f32e6bbec-16b6-44c2-be37-c5b672d103cf)). | Medium |
| [Azure SQL Managed Instances should disable public network access](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Disabling public network access (public endpoint) on Azure SQL Managed Instances improves security by ensuring that they can only be accessed from inside their virtual networks or via Private Endpoints. Learn more about [public network access](https://aka.ms/mi-public-endpoint). (Related policy: [Azure SQL Managed Instances should disable public network access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f9dfea752-dd46-4766-aed1-c355fa93fb91)). | Medium |
| [Storage accounts should prevent shared key access](recommendations-reference.md#data-recommendations) | Audit requirement of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to authorize requests for your storage account. By default, requests can be authorized with either Azure Active Directory credentials, or by using the account access key for Shared Key authorization. Of these two types of authorization, Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over shared Key, and is recommended by Microsoft. (Related policy: [Storage accounts should prevent shared key access](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f8c6a50c6-9ffd-4ae7-986f-5fa6111f9a54)). |Medium |

### Risk prioritization is now available for recommendations

November 15, 2023

You can now prioritize your security recommendations according to the risk level they pose, taking in to consideration both the exploitability and potential business effect of each underlying security issue.

By organizing your recommendations based on their risk level (Critical, high, medium, low), you're able to address the most critical risks within your environment and efficiently prioritize the remediation of security issues based on the actual risk such as internet exposure, data sensitivity, lateral movement possibilities, and potential attack paths that could be mitigated by resolving the recommendations.

Learn more about [risk prioritization](implement-security-recommendations.md#group-recommendations-by-risk-level).

### Attack path analysis new engine and extensive enhancements

November 15, 2023

We're releasing enhancements to the attack path analysis capabilities in Defender for Cloud.  

- **New engine** - attack path analysis has a new engine, which uses path-finding algorithm to detect every possible attack path that exists in your cloud environment (based on the data we have in our graph). We can find many more attack paths in your environment and detect more complex and sophisticated attack patterns that attackers can use to breach your organization.

- **Improvements** - The following improvements are released:

  - **Risk prioritization** - prioritized list of attack paths based on risk (exploitability & business affect).
  - **Enhanced remediation** - pinpointing the specific recommendations that should be resolved to actually break the chain.
  - **Cross-cloud attack paths** – detection of attack paths that are cross-clouds (paths that start in one cloud and end in another).
  - **MITRE** – Mapping all attack paths to the MITRE framework.
  - **Refreshed user experience** – refreshed experience with stronger capabilities: advanced filters, search, and grouping of attack paths to allow easier triage.

Learn [how to identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).

### Changes to Attack Path's Azure Resource Graph table scheme

Public Preview announcement: [New expanded visibility into multicloud data security in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/new-expanded-visibility-into-multicloud-data-security-in/ba-p/3913010).

### New version of the recommendation to find missing system updates is now GA

November 6, 2023

An extra agent is no longer needed on your Azure VMs and Azure Arc machines to ensure the machines have all of the latest security or critical system updates.

The new system updates recommendation, `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)` in the `Apply system updates` control, is based on the [Update Manager](/azure/update-center/overview) and is now fully GA. The recommendation relies on a native agent embedded in every Azure VM and Azure Arc machines instead of an installed agent. The quick fix in the new recommendation navigates you to a one-time installation of the missing updates in the Update Manager portal.

The old and the new versions of the recommendations to find missing system updates will both be available until August 2024, which is when the older version is deprecated. Both recommendations: `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Azure Update Manager)`and `System updates should be installed on your machines` are available under the same control: `Apply system updates` and has the same results. Thus, there's no duplication in the effect on the secure score.

We recommend migrating to the new recommendation and remove the old one, by disabling it from Defender for Cloud's built-in initiative in Azure policy.

The recommendation `[Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/90386950-71ca-4357-a12e-486d1679427c)` is also GA and is a prerequisite, which will have a negative effect on your Secure Score. You can remediate the negative effect with the available Fix.  

To apply the new recommendation, you need to:

1. Connect your non-Azure machines to Arc.
1. Turn on the [periodic assessment property](/azure/update-center/assessment-options). You can use the Quick Fix in the new recommendation, `[Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/90386950-71ca-4357-a12e-486d1679427c)` to fix the recommendation.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling periodic assessments for Arc enabled machines that Defender for Servers Plan 2 isn't enabled on their related Subscription or Connector, is subject to [Azure Update Manager pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-update-management-center/). Arc enabled machines that [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features) is enabled on their related Subscription or Connectors, or any Azure VM, are eligible for this capability with no additional cost.

### Exempt functionality now available for Defender for APIs recommendations

September 11, 2023

You can now exempt recommendations for the following Defender for APIs security recommendations.

| Recommendation | Description & related policy | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| (Preview) API endpoints that are unused should be disabled and removed from the Azure API Management service | As a security best practice, API endpoints that haven't received traffic for 30 days are considered unused, and should be removed from the Azure API Management service. Keeping unused API endpoints might pose a security risk. These might be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service, but have accidentally been left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up-to-date security coverage. | Low |
| (Preview) API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated | API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. For APIs published in Azure API Management, this recommendation assesses the execution of authentication via the Subscription Keys, JWT, and Client Certificate configured within Azure API Management. If none of these authentication mechanisms are executed during the API call, the API will receive this recommendation. | High |

### Sensitive data discovery for PaaS databases (Preview)

September 5, 2023

Data-aware security posture capabilities for frictionless sensitive data discovery for PaaS Databases (Azure SQL Databases and Amazon RDS Instances of any type) are now in public preview. This public preview allows you to create a map of your critical data wherever it resides, and the type of data that is found in those databases.

Sensitive data discovery for Azure and AWS databases, adds to the shared taxonomy and configuration, which is already publicly available for cloud object storage resources (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3 buckets and GCP storage buckets) and provides a single configuration and enablement experience.

Databases are scanned on a weekly basis. If you enable `sensitive data discovery`, discovery runs within 24 hours. The results can be viewed in the [Cloud Security Explorer](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md) or by reviewing the new [attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md) for managed databases with sensitive data.

Data-aware security posture for databases is available through the [Defender CSPM plan](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md), and is automatically enabled on subscriptions where `sensitive data discovery` option is enabled.

You can learn more about data aware security posture in the following articles:

- [Support and prerequisites for data-aware security posture](concept-data-security-posture-prepare.md)
- [Enable data-aware security posture](data-security-posture-enable.md)

### Recommendation release: Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection

August 22, 2023

A new recommendation in Defender for Storage has been released. This recommendation ensures that Defender for Storage is enabled at the subscription level with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection capabilities.

| Recommendation | Description  |
|--|--|
| Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled with malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection | Microsoft Defender for Storage detects potential threats to your storage accounts. It helps prevent the three major impacts on your data and workload: malicious file uploads, sensitive data exfiltration, and data corruption. The new Defender for Storage plan includes malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection. This plan also provides a predictable pricing structure (per storage account) for control over coverage and costs. With a simple agentless setup at scale, when enabled at the subscription level, all existing and newly created storage accounts under that subscription will be automatically protected. You can also exclude specific storage accounts from protected subscriptions.|

This new recommendation replaces the current recommendation `Microsoft Defender for Storage should be enabled` (assessment key 1be22853-8ed1-4005-9907-ddad64cb1417). However, this recommendation will still be available in Azure Government clouds.

Learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-introduction.md).

### Extended properties in Defender for Cloud security alerts are masked from activity logs

August 17, 2023

We recently changed the way security alerts and activity logs are integrated. To better protect sensitive customer information, we no longer include this information in activity logs. Instead, we mask it with asterisks. However, this information is still available through the alerts API, continuous export, and the Defender for Cloud portal.

Customers who rely on activity logs to export alerts to their SIEM solutions should consider using a different solution, as it isn't the recommended method for exporting Defender for Cloud security alerts.

For instructions on how to export Defender for Cloud security alerts to SIEM, SOAR and other third party applications, see [Stream alerts to a SIEM, SOAR, or IT Service Management solution](export-to-siem.md).

### New security alerts in Defender for Servers Plan 2: Detecting potential attacks abusing Azure virtual machine extensions

August 7, 2023

This new series of alerts focuses on detecting suspicious activities of Azure virtual machine extensions and provides insights into attackers' attempts to compromise and perform malicious activities on your virtual machines.

Microsoft Defender for Servers can now detect suspicious activity of the virtual machine extensions, allowing you to get better coverage of the workloads security.  

Azure virtual machine extensions are small applications that run post-deployment on virtual machines and provide capabilities such as configuration, automation, monitoring, security, and more. While extensions are a powerful tool, they can be used by threat actors for various malicious intents, for example:

- Data collection and monitoring
- Code execution and configuration deployment with high privileges
- Resetting credentials and creating administrative users
- Encrypting disks

Here's a table of the new alerts.

|Alert (alert type)|Description|MITRE tactics|Severity|
|----|----|----|----|
