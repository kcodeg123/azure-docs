Azure Database for MySQL powered by the MySQL community edition is available in two deployment modes:

- Azure Database for MySQL flexible server
- Azure Database for MySQL single server

This article provides an overview and introduction to core concepts of the flexible server deployment model. For information on how to decide what deployment option is appropriate for your workload, see [choosing the right MySQL server option in Azure](./../select-right-deployment-type.md).

## Overview

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server is a fully managed production-ready database service designed for more granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings. The flexible server architecture allows users to opt for high availability within single availability zone and across multiple availability zones. Flexible servers provide better cost optimization controls with the ability to stop/start server and burstable compute tier, ideal for workloads that don’t need full-compute capacity continuously. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server also supports reserved instances allowing you to save up to 63% cost, ideal for production workloads with predictable compute capacity requirements. The service supports community version of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0. The service is generally available today in wide variety of [Azure regions](overview.md#azure-regions).

The flexible server deployment option offers three compute tiers: Burstable, General Purpose, and Business Critical. Each tier offers different compute and memory capacity to support your database workloads. You can build your first app on a burstable tier for a few dollars a month, and then adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you need, and only when you need them. See [Compute and Storage](concepts-compute-storage.md) for details.

Flexible servers are best suited for
- Ease of deployment, simplified scaling, and low database management overhead for functions such as backups, high availability, security, and monitoring.
- Application developments requiring community version of MySQL with better control and customizations.
- Production workloads with same-zone, zone-redundant high availability, and managed maintenance windows.
- Simplified development experience.
- Enterprise grade security, compliance, and privacy.

You can take advantage of this offer to develop and deploy applications that use Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. To learn how to create and use Azure Database for MySQL flexible server for free using Azure free account, refer [this tutorial](how-to-deploy-on-azure-free-account.md).

## High availability within and across availability zones

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server allows configuring high availability with automatic failover. The high availability solution is designed to ensure that committed data is never lost due to failures, and improve overall uptime for your application. When high availability is configured, flexible server automatically provisions and manages a standby replica. You're billed for the provisioned compute and storage for both the primary and secondary replica. There are two high availability-architectural models:

- **Zone Redundant High Availability (HA):** This option is preferred for complete isolation and redundancy of infrastructure across multiple availability zones. It provides highest level of availability, but it requires you to configure application redundancy across zones. Zone redundant HA is preferred when you want to achieve highest level of availability against any infrastructure failure in the availability zone and where latency across the availability zone is acceptable. Zone redundant HA is available in [subset of Azure regions](overview.md#azure-regions) where the region supports multiple Availability Zones and Zone redundant Premium file shares are available.

- **Same-Zone High Availability (HA):** This option is preferred for infrastructure redundancy with lower network latency as both primary and standby server are in the same availability zone. It provides high availability without configuring application redundancy across zones. Same-Zone HA is preferred when you want to achieve highest level of availability within a single Availability zone with the lowest network latency. Same-Zone HA is available in [all Azure regions](overview.md#azure-regions) where you can create Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instances.

For more information, see [high availability concepts](concepts-high-availability.md).

## Automated patching with managed maintenance window

The service performs automated patching of the underlying hardware, OS, and database engine. The patching includes security and software updates. For MySQL engine, minor version upgrades are also included as part of the planned maintenance release. Users can configure the patching schedule to be system managed or define their custom schedule. During the maintenance schedule, the patch is applied and server might require a restart as part of the patching process to complete the update. With the custom schedule, users can make their patching cycle predictable and choose a maintenance window with minimum impact to the business. In general, the service follows monthly release schedule as part of the continuous integration and release.

For more information, see [Scheduled Maintenance](concepts-maintenance.md).

## Automatic backups

The Azure Database for MySQL flexible server service automatically creates server backups and stores them in user configured locally redundant or geo-redundant storage. Backups can be used to restore your server to any point-in-time within the backup retention period. The default backup retention period is seven days. The retention can be optionally configured between 1-35 days. All backups are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption.

For more information, see [Backup concepts](concepts-backup-restore.md).

## Network Isolation

You have two networking options to connect to Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. The options are **private access (VNet integration)** and **public access (allowed IP addresses)**.

- **Private access (VNet Integration)** – You can deploy your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance into your [Azure Virtual Network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md). Azure virtual networks provide private and secure network communication. Resources in a virtual network can communicate through private IP addresses.

  Choose the virtual network Integration option if you want the following capabilities:

  - Connect from Azure resources in the same virtual network to your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance using private IP addresses.
  - Use VPN or ExpressRoute to connect from non-Azure resources to your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance.
  - No public endpoint.

- **Public access (allowed IP addresses)** – You can deploy your Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance with a public endpoint. The public endpoint is a publicly resolvable DNS address. The phrase "allowed IP addresses" refers to a range of IPs you choose to give permission to access your server. These permissions are called **firewall rules**.

For more information, see [Networking concepts](concepts-networking.md).

## Adjust performance and scale within seconds

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server is available in three service tiers: Burstable, General Purpose, and Business Critical. The Burstable tier is best suited for low-cost development and low concurrency workloads that don't need full-compute capacity continuously. General Purpose and Business Critical are better suited for production workloads requiring high concurrency, scale, and predictable performance. You can build your first app on a small database for a few dollars a month, and then seamlessly adjust the scale to meet the needs of your solution. The storage scaling is online and supports storage autogrowth. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server enables you to provision additional IOPS up to 80 K IOPs above the complimentary IOPS limit independent of storage. Using this feature, you can increase or decrease the number of IOPS provisioned based on your workload requirements at any time. Dynamic scalability enables your database to transparently respond to rapidly changing resource requirements. You only pay for the resources you consume.

For more information, see [Compute and Storage concepts](concepts-compute-storage.md).

## Scale out your read workload with up to 10 read replicas

MySQL is one of the popular database engines for running internet-scale web and mobile applications. Many of our customers use it for their online education services, video streaming services, digital payment solutions, e-commerce platforms, gaming services, news portals, government, and healthcare websites. These services are required to serve and scale as the traffic on the web or mobile application increases.

On the applications side, the application is typically developed in Java or PHP and migrated to run on [Azure virtual machine scale sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) or [Azure App Services](../../app-service/overview.md) or are containerized to run on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../../aks/intro-kubernetes.md). Using a virtual machine scale set with App Service or AKS as the underlying infrastructure simplifies application scaling by instantaneously provisioning new VMs and replicating the stateless components of applications to cater to the requests but often, database ends up being a bottleneck as centralized stateful component.

The read replica feature allows you to replicate data from an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instance to a read-only server. You can replicate from the source server to **up to 10 replicas**. Replicas are updated asynchronously using the MySQL engine's native [binary log (binlog) file position-based replication technology](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-features.html). You can use a load balancer proxy solution like [ProxySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/load-balance-read-replicas-using-proxysql-in-azure-database-for/ba-p/880042) to seamlessly scale out your application workload to read replicas without any application refactoring cost.

For more information, see [Read Replica concepts](concepts-read-replicas.md).

## Set up hybrid or multicloud data synchronization with data-in replication

Data-in replication allows you to synchronize data from an external MySQL server into Azure Database for MySQL flexible server. The external server can be on-premises, in virtual machines, Azure Database for MySQL single server, or a database service hosted by other cloud providers. Data-in replication is based on the binary log (binlog) file position-based. The main scenarios to consider about using Data-in replication are:

- Hybrid Data Synchronization
- Multicloud Synchronization
- [Minimal downtime migration to Azure Database for MySQL flexible server](../../mysql/howto-migrate-single-flexible-minimum-downtime.md)

For more information, see [Data-in replication concepts](concepts-data-in-replication.md).

## Stop/Start server to optimize cost

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server allows you to stop and start servers on-demand to optimize cost. The compute tier billing is stopped immediately when the server is stopped. This functionality can allow you to have significant cost savings during development, testing and for time-bound predictable production workloads. The server remains in stopped state for 30 days unless restarted sooner.

For more information, see [Server concepts](concept-servers.md).

## Enterprise grade security, compliance, and privacy

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server uses the FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic module for storage encryption of data at-rest. Data, including backups, and temporary files created while running queries are encrypted. The service uses the AES 256-bit cipher included in Azure storage encryption, and the keys can be system managed (default).

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server encrypts data in-motion with transport layer security enforced by default. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server by default supports encrypted connections using Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2) and all incoming connections with TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are denied. You can disable TSL/SSL enforcement by setting the require_secure_transport server parameter and then setting the minimum tls_version for your server.

For more information, see [how to use encrypted connections to Azure Database for MySQL flexible server instances](how-to-connect-tls-ssl.md).

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server allows full-private access to the servers using [Azure virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) (virtual network) integration. Servers in Azure virtual network can only be reached and connected through private IP addresses. With virtual network integration, public access is denied and servers can’t be reached using public endpoints.

For more information, see [Networking concepts](concepts-networking.md).

## Monitoring and alerting

Azure Database for MySQL flexible server is equipped with built-in performance monitoring and alerting features. All Azure metrics have a one-minute frequency, and each metric provides 30 days of history. You can configure alerts on the metrics. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server exposes host server metrics to monitor resources utilization, allows configuring slow query logs. Using these tools, you can quickly optimize your workloads, and configure your server for best performance. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server allows you to visualize the slow query and audit logs data using Azure Monitor workbooks. With workbooks, you get a flexible canvas for analyzing data and creating rich visual reports within the Azure portal. Azure Database for MySQL flexible server provides three available workbook templates out of the box including Server Overview, [Auditing](tutorial-configure-audit.md) and [Query Performance Insights](tutorial-query-performance-insights.md). [Query Performance Insights](tutorial-query-performance-insights.md) workbook is designed to help you spend less time troubleshooting database performance by providing such information as:

- Top N long-running queries and their trends.
- The query details: view the query text and the history of execution with minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation query time.
- The resource utilizations (CPU, memory, and storage).

In addition, you can use and integrate with community monitoring tools like [Percona Monitoring and Management with Azure Database for MySQL flexible server](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/monitor-azure-database-for-mysql-using-percona-monitoring-and/ba-p/2568545).

For more information, see [Monitoring concepts](concepts-monitoring.md).
