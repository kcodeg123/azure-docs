# Reliability guidance overview 

Azure reliability guidance contains the following:

- **Service-specific reliability guides**. Each guide can cover both intra-regional resiliency with [availability zones](availability-zones-overview.md) and information on [cross-region resiliency with disaster recovery](cross-region-replication-azure.md). 
For a more detailed overview of reliability principles in Azure, see [Reliability in Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/).

- **Azure Service Manager (ASM) Retirement guides**. ASM is the old control plane of Azure responsible for creating, managing, deleting VMs and performing other control plane operations, and has been in use since 2011. ASM is retiring in August 2024, and customers can now migrate to [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview). ARM provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You can use management features like access control, locks, and tags to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

## Azure Service Manager Retirement

Azure Service Manager (ASM) is the old control plane of Azure responsible for creating, managing, deleting VMs and performing other control plane operations, and has been in use since 2011. ASM is retiring in August 2024, and customers can now migrate to [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview). 

For more information on specific retirement dates and migration documentation, see [Azure Service Manager Retirement](./asm-retirement.md).
