# Upgrade to the latest REST API in Azure AI Search

Use this article to migrate data plane calls to newer *stable* versions of the [**Search REST API**](/rest/api/searchservice/).

+ [**2023-11-01**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-11-01) is the most recent stable version. Semantic ranking and vector search support are generally available in this version.

+ [**2023-10-01-preview**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-10-01-preview) is the most recent preview version. [Integrated data chunking and vectorization](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) using the [Text Split](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) skill and [Azure OpenAI Embedding](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md) skill are introduced in this version. *There's no migration guidance for preview API versions*, but you can review [code samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples) and [walkthroughs](vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer.md) for help with new features.

## How to upgrade

Azure AI Search strives for backward compatibility. To upgrade and continue with existing functionality, you can usually just change the API version number. Conversely, situations calling for change codes include:

+ Your code fails when unrecognized properties are returned in an API response. As a best practice, your application should ignore properties that it doesn't understand.

+ Your code persists API requests and tries to resend them to the new API version. For example, this might happen if your application persists continuation tokens returned from the Search API (for more information, look for `@search.nextPageParameters` in the [Search API Reference](/rest/api/searchservice/Search-Documents)).

+ Your code references an API version that predates 2019-05-06 and is subject to one or more of the breaking changes in that release. The section [Upgrade to 2019-05-06](#upgrade-to-2019-05-06) provides more detail. 

If any of these situations apply to you, change your code to maintain existing functionality. Otherwise, no changes should be necessary, although you might want to start using features added in the new version.

## Upgrade to 2023-11-01

This version has breaking changes and behavioral differences for semantic ranking and vector search support. 

+ [Semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) no longer uses `queryLanguage`. It also requires a `semanticConfiguration` definition. If you're migrating from 2020-06-30-preview, a semantic configuration replaces `searchFields`. See [Migrate from preview version](semantic-how-to-configure.md#migrate-from-preview-versions) for steps.

+ [Vector search](vector-search-overview.md) support was introduced in [Create or Update Index (2023-07-01-preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/create-or-update-index). If you're migrating from that version, there are new options and several breaking changes. New options include vector filter mode, vector profiles, and an exhaustive K-nearest neighbors algorithm and query-time exhaustive k-NN flag. Breaking changes include renaming and restructuring the vector configuration in the index, and vector query syntax.

If you added vector support using 2023-10-01-preview, there are no breaking changes, but there's one behavior difference: the `vectorFilterMode` default changed from postfilter to prefilter for [filter expressions](vector-search-filters.md). The default is  prefilter for indexes created after 2023-10-01. Indexes created before that date only support postfilter, regardless of how you set the filter mode. 

> [!TIP]
> Azure portal supports a one-click upgrade path for 2023-07-01-preview indexes. The portal detects 2023-07-01-preview indexes and provides a **Migrate** button. Before selecting **Migrate**, select **Edit JSON** to review the updated schema first. You should find a schema that conforms to the changes described in this section. Portal migration only handles indexes with one vector search algorithm configuration, creating a default profile that maps to the algorithm. Indexes with multiple configurations require manual migration.

Here are the steps for migrating from 2023-07-01-preview:

1. Call [Get Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/get?view=rest-searchservice-2023-11-01&tabs=HTTP&preserve-view=true) to retrieve the existing definition.

1. Modify the vector search configuration. This API introduces the concept of "vector profiles" which bundles together vector-related configurations under one name. It also renames `algorithmConfigurations` to `algorithms`.

   + Rename `algorithmConfigurations` to `algorithms`. This is only a renaming of the array. The contents are backwards compatible. This means your existing HNSW configuration parameters can be used.

   + Add `profiles`, giving a name and an algorithm configuration for each one.

    **Before migration (2023-07-01-preview)**:

    ```http
      "vectorSearch": {
        "algorithmConfigurations": [
            {
                "name": "myHnswConfig",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            }
        ]}
    ```

    **After migration (2023-11-01)**:

    ```http
      "vectorSearch": {
        "profiles": [
          {
            "name": "myHnswProfile",
            "algorithm": "myHnswConfig"
          }
        ],
        "algorithms": [
          {
            "name": "myHnswConfig",
            "kind": "hnsw",
            "hnswParameters": {
              "m": 4,
              "efConstruction": 400,
              "efSearch": 500,
              "metric": "cosine"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ```

1. Modify vector field definitions, replacing `vectorSearchConfiguration` with `vectorSearchProfile`. Make sure the profile name resolves to a new vector profile definition, and not the algorithm configuration name. Other vector field properties remain unchanged. For example, they can't be filterable, sortable, or facetable, nor use analyzers or normalizers or synonym maps.

    **Before (2023-07-01-preview)**:

    ```http
      {
          "name": "contentVector",
          "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)",
          "key": false,
          "searchable": true,
          "retrievable": true,
          "filterable": false,  
          "sortable": false,  
          "facetable": false,
          "analyzer": "",
          "searchAnalyzer": "",
          "indexAnalyzer": "",
          "normalizer": "",
          "synonymMaps": "", 
          "dimensions": 1536,
          "vectorSearchConfiguration": "myHnswConfig"
      }
    ```

    **After (2023-11-01)**:

    ```http
      {
        "name": "contentVector",
        "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)",
        "searchable": true,
        "retrievable": true,
        "filterable": false,  
        "sortable": false,  
        "facetable": false,
        "analyzer": "",
        "searchAnalyzer": "",
        "indexAnalyzer": "",
        "normalizer": "",
        "synonymMaps": "", 
        "dimensions": 1536,
        "vectorSearchProfile": "myHnswProfile"
      }
    ```

1. Call [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-11-01&tabs=HTTP&preserve-view=true) to post the changes. 

1. Modify [Search POST](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post?view=rest-searchservice-2023-11-01&tabs=HTTP&preserve-view=true) to change the query syntax. This API change enables support for polymorphic vector query types.

   + Rename `vectors` to `vectorQueries`.
   + For each vector query, add `kind`, setting it to "vector".
   + For each vector query, rename `value` to `vector`.
   + Optionally, add `vectorFilterMode` if you're using [filter expressions](vector-search-filters.md). The default is  prefilter for indexes created after 2023-10-01. Indexes created before that date only support postfilter, regardless of how you set the filter mode. 

    **Before (2023-07-01-preview)**:

    ```http
    {
        "search": (this parameter is ignored in vector search),
        "vectors": [
          {
            "value": [
                0.103,
                0.0712,
                0.0852,
                0.1547,
                0.1183
            ],
            "fields": "contentVector",
            "k": 5
          }
        ],
        "select": "title, content, category"
    }
    ```

    **After (2023-11-01)**:

    ```http
    {
      "search": "(this parameter is ignored in vector search)",
      "vectorQueries": [
        {
          "kind": "vector",
          "vector": [
            0.103,
            0.0712,
            0.0852,
            0.1547,
            0.1183
          ],
          "fields": "contentVector",
          "k": 5
        }
      ],
      "vectorFilterMode": "preFilter",
      "select": "title, content, category"
    }
    ```

These steps complete the migration to 2023-11-01 API version.

## Upgrade to 2020-06-30

In this version, there's one breaking change and several behavioral differences. Generally available features include:

+ [Knowledge store](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md), persistent storage of enriched content created through skillsets, created for downstream analysis and processing through other applications. A knowledge store exists in Azure Storage, which you provision and then provide connection details to a skillset. With this capability, an indexer-driven AI enrichment pipeline can populate a knowledge store in addition to a search index. If you used the preview version of this feature, it's equivalent to the generally available version. The only code change required is modifying the api-version.

### Breaking change

Existing code written against earlier API versions will break on api-version=2020-06-30 and later if code contains the following functionality:

* Any Edm.Date literals (a date composed of year-month-day, such as `2020-12-12`) in filter expressions must follow the Edm.DateTimeOffset format: `2020-12-12T00:00:00Z`. This change was necessary to handle erroneous or unexpected query results due to timezone differences.

### Behavior changes

* [BM25 ranking algorithm](index-ranking-similarity.md) replaces the previous ranking algorithm with newer technology. Services created after 2019 use this algorithm automatically. For older services, you must set parameters to use the new algorithm.  

* Ordered results for null values have changed in this version, with null values appearing first if the sort is `asc` and last if the sort is `desc`. If you wrote code to handle how null values are sorted, be aware of this change.

## Upgrade to 2019-05-06

Version 2019-05-06 is the previous generally available release of the REST API. Features that became generally available in this API version include:

* [Autocomplete](index-add-suggesters.md) is a typeahead feature that completes a partially specified term input.
* [Complex types](search-howto-complex-data-types.md) provides native support for structured object data in search index.
* [JsonLines parsing modes](search-howto-index-json-blobs.md), part of Azure Blob indexing, creates one search document per JSON entity that is separated by a newline.
* [AI enrichment](cognitive-search-concept-intro.md) provides indexing that uses the AI enrichment engines of Azure AI services.

### Breaking changes

Existing code written against earlier API versions will break on api-version=2019-05-06 and later if code contains the following functionality:

#### Indexer for Azure Cosmos DB - datasource is now `"type": "cosmosdb"`

If you're using an [Azure Cosmos DB indexer](search-howto-index-cosmosdb.md), you must change `"type": "documentdb"` to `"type": "cosmosdb"`.

#### Indexer execution result errors no longer have status

The error structure for indexer execution previously had a `status` element. This element was removed because it wasn't providing useful information.

#### Indexer data source API no longer returns connection strings

From API versions 2019-05-06 and 2019-05-06-Preview onwards, the data source API no longer returns connection strings in the response of any REST operation. In previous API versions, for data sources created using POST, Azure AI Search returned **201** followed by the OData response, which contained the connection string in plain text.

#### Named Entity Recognition cognitive skill is now discontinued

If you called the [Name Entity Recognition](cognitive-search-skill-named-entity-recognition.md) skill in your code, the call fails. Replacement functionality is [Entity Recognition Skill (V3)](cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition-v3.md). Follow the recommendations in [Deprecated skills](cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md) to migrate to a supported skill.

### Upgrading complex types

API version 2019-05-06 added formal support for complex types. If your code implemented previous recommendations for complex type equivalency in 2017-11-11-Preview or 2016-09-01-Preview, there are some new and changed limits starting in version 2019-05-06 of which you need to be aware:

+ The limits on the depth of subfields and the number of complex collections per index have been lowered. If you created indexes that exceed these limits using the preview api-versions, any attempt to update or recreate them using API version 2019-05-06 will fail. If you find yourself in this situation, you need to redesign your schema to fit within the new limits and then rebuild your index.

+ There's a new limit starting in api-version 2019-05-06 on the number of elements of complex collections per document. If you created indexes with documents that exceed these limits using the preview api-versions, any attempt to reindex that data using api-version 2019-05-06 will fail. If you find yourself in this situation, you need to reduce the number of complex collection elements per document before reindexing your data.

For more information, see [Service limits for Azure AI Search](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md).

#### How to upgrade an old complex type structure

If your code is using complex types with one of the older preview API versions, you might be using an index definition format that looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "hotels",  
  "fields": [
    { "name": "HotelId", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "filterable": true },
    { "name": "HotelName", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": true, "facetable": false },
    { "name": "Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.microsoft" },
    { "name": "Description_fr", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "fr.microsoft" },
    { "name": "Category", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": false, "facetable": true, "analyzer": "tagsAnalyzer" },
    { "name": "ParkingIncluded", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "LastRenovationDate", "type": "Edm.DateTimeOffset", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Rating", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Address", "type": "Edm.ComplexType" },
    { "name": "Address/StreetAddress", "type": "Edm.String", "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "searchable": true },
    { "name": "Address/City", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Address/StateProvince", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Address/PostalCode", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Address/Country", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Location", "type": "Edm.GeographyPoint", "filterable": true, "sortable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms", "type": "Collection(Edm.ComplexType)" }, 
    { "name": "Rooms/Description", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "en.lucene" },
    { "name": "Rooms/Description_fr", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "sortable": false, "facetable": false, "analyzer": "fr.lucene" },
    { "name": "Rooms/Type", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms/BaseRate", "type": "Edm.Double", "filterable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms/BedOptions", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms/SleepsCount", "type": "Edm.Int32", "filterable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms/SmokingAllowed", "type": "Edm.Boolean", "filterable": true, "facetable": true },
    { "name": "Rooms/Tags", "type": "Collection(Edm.String)", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "facetable": true, "analyzer": "tagsAnalyzer" }
  ]
}  
```

A newer tree-like format for defining index fields was introduced in API version 2017-11-11-Preview. In the new format, each complex field has a fields collection where its subfields are defined. In API version 2019-05-06, this new format is used exclusively and attempting to create or update an index using the old format will fail. If you have indexes created using the old format, you'll need to use API version 2017-11-11-Preview to update them to the new format before they can be managed using API version 2019-05-06.

You can update "flat" indexes to the new format with the following steps using API version 2017-11-11-Preview:

1. Perform a GET request to retrieve your index. If it’s already in the new format, you’re done.

2. Translate the index from the “flat” format to the new format. You have to write code for this task since there's no sample code available at the time of this writing.

3. Perform a PUT request to update the index to the new format. Avoid changing any other details of the index, such as the searchability/filterability of fields, because changes that affect the physical expression of existing index isn't allowed by the Update Index API.

> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to manage indexes created with the old "flat" format from the Azure portal. Please upgrade your indexes from the “flat” representation to the “tree” representation at your earliest convenience.
