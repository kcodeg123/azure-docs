# Create a vector store

In Azure AI Search, a *vector store* has an index schema that defines vector and nonvector fields, a vector configuration for algorithms that create the embedding space, and settings on vector field definitions that are used in query requests. The [Create Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) API creates the vector store.

Follow these steps to index vector data:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> + Define a schema with one or more vector configurations that specifies algorithms for indexing and search 
> + Add one or more vector fields
> + Load prevectorized data [as a separate step](#load-vector-data-for-indexing), or use [integrated vectorization (preview)](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) for data chunking and encoding during indexing.

This article applies to the generally available, non-preview version of [vector search](vector-search-overview.md), which assumes your application code calls external resources for chunking and encoding.

## Prerequisites

+ Azure AI Search, in any region and on any tier. Most existing services support vector search. For services created prior to January 2019, there's a small subset that can't support vector search. If an index containing vector fields fails to be created or updated, this is an indicator. In this situation, a new service must be created.

+ Pre-existing vector embeddings in your source documents. Azure AI Search doesn't generate vectors in the generally available version of the Azure SDKs and REST APIs. We recommend [Azure OpenAI embedding models](/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models) but you can use any model for vectorization. For more information, see [Generate embeddings](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md).

+ You should know the dimensions limit of the model used to create the embeddings and how similarity is computed. In Azure OpenAI, for **text-embedding-ada-002**, the length of the numerical vector is 1536. Similarity is computed using `cosine`.

+ You should be familiar with [creating an index](search-how-to-create-search-index.md). The schema must include a field for the document key, other fields you want to search or filter, and other configurations for behaviors needed during indexing and queries. 

## Prepare documents for indexing

Prior to indexing, assemble a document payload that includes fields of vector and non-vector data. The document structure must conform to the index schema. 

Make sure your documents:

1. Provide a field or a metadata property that uniquely identifies each document. All search indexes require a document key. To satisfy document key requirements, a source document must have one field or property that can uniquely identify it in the index. This source field must be mapped to an index field of type `Edm.String` and `key=true` in the search index. 

1. Provide vector data (an array of single-precision floating point numbers) in source fields.

   Vector fields contain numeric data generated by embedding models, one embedding per field. We recommend the embedding models in [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access), such as **text-embedding-ada-002** for text documents or the [Image Retrieval REST API](/rest/api/computervision/2023-02-01-preview/image-retrieval/vectorize-image) for images.

1. Provide other fields with human-readable alphanumeric content for the query response, and for hybrid query scenarios that include full text search or semantic ranking in the same request. 

Your search index should include fields and content for all of the query scenarios you want to support. Suppose you want to search or filter over product names, versions, metadata, or addresses. In this case, similarity search isn't especially helpful. Keyword search, geo-search, or filters would be a better choice. A search index that includes a comprehensive field collection of vector and non-vector data provides maximum flexibility for query construction and response composition.

A short example of a documents payload that includes vector and non-vector fields is in the [load vector data](#load-vector-data-for-indexing) section of this article.

## Add a vector search configuration

A vector configuration specifies the [vector search algorithm](vector-search-ranking.md) and parameters used during indexing to create "nearest neighbor" information among the vector nodes:

+ Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)
+ Exhaustive KNN

If you choose HNSW on a field, you can opt in for exhaustive KNN at query time. But the other direction won’t work: if you choose exhaustive, you can’t later request HNSW search because the extra data structures that enable approximate search don’t exist.

### [**2023-11-01**](#tab/config-2023-11-01)

REST API version [**2023-11-01**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-11-01) supports a vector configuration having:

+ `vectorSearch` algorithms, `hnsw` and `exhaustiveKnn` nearest neighbors, with parameters for indexing and scoring.
+ `vectorProfiles` for multiple combinations of algorithm configurations.

Be sure to have a strategy for [vectorizing your content](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md). The stable version doesn't provide [vectorizers](vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer.md) for built-in embedding.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) API to create the index.

1. Add a `vectorSearch` section in the index that specifies the search algorithms used to create the embedding space. 

   ```json
    "vectorSearch": {
        "algorithms": [
            {
                "name": "my-hnsw-config-1",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "my-hnsw-config-2",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 8,
                    "efConstruction": 800,
                    "efSearch": 800,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "my-eknn-config",
                "kind": "exhaustiveKnn",
                "exhaustiveKnnParameters": {
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            }

        ],
        "profiles": [
          {
            "name": "my-default-vector-profile",
            "algorithm": "my-hnsw-config-2"
          }
        ]
    }
   ```

   **Key points**:

   + Name of the configuration. The name must be unique within the index.
   + `profiles` add a layer of abstraction for accommodating richer definitions. A profile is defined in `vectorSearch`, and then referenced by name on each vector field.
   + `"hnsw"` and `"exhaustiveKnn"` are the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms used to organize vector content during indexing.
   + `"m"` (bi-directional link count) default is 4. The range is 4 to 10. Lower values should return less noise in the results. 
   + `"efConstruction"` default is 400. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing.
   + `"efSearch"` default is 500. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during search.
   + `"metric"` should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric associated with the embedding model you're using. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`.

### [**2023-10-01-Preview**](#tab/config-2023-10-01-Preview)

REST API version [**2023-10-01-Preview**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-10-01-Preview) supports external and [internal vectorization](vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer.md). This section assumes an external vectorization strategy. This API supports:

+ `vectorSearch` algorithms, `hnsw` and `exhaustiveKnn` nearest neighbors, with parameters for indexing and scoring.
+ `vectorProfiles` for multiple combinations of algorithm configurations.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) to create the index.

1. Add a `vectorSearch` section in the index that specifies the search algorithms used to create the embedding space. 

   ```json
    "vectorSearch": {
        "algorithms": [
            {
                "name": "my-hnsw-config-1",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "my-hnsw-config-2",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 8,
                    "efConstruction": 800,
                    "efSearch": 800,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "my-eknn-config",
                "kind": "exhaustiveKnn",
                "exhaustiveKnnParameters": {
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            }

        ],
        "profiles": [
          {
            "name": "my-default-vector-profile",
            "algorithm": "my-hnsw-config-2"
          }
        ]
    }
   ```

   **Key points**:

   + Name of the configuration. The name must be unique within the index.
   + `profiles` are new in this preview. They add a layer of abstraction for accommodating richer definitions. A profile is defined in `vectorSearch`, and then as a property on each vector field.
   + `hnsw` and `"exhaustiveKnn"` are the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithms used to organize vector content during indexing.
   + `m` (bi-directional link count) default is 4. The range is 4 to 10. Lower values should return less noise in the results. 
   + `efConstruction` default is 400. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing.
   + `efSearch` default is 500. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during search.
   + `metric` should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric associated with the embedding model you're using. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`.

### [**2023-07-01-Preview**](#tab/rest-add-config)

REST API version [**2023-07-01-Preview**](/rest/api/searchservice/index-preview) was the first REST API version to support vector scenarios. This version has:

+ `vectorSearch` for specifying the HNSW algorithm.
+ `hnsw` nearest neighbor algorithm for indexing vector content

1. Use the [Create or Update Index REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/create-or-update-index) to create the index.

1. Add a `vectorSearch` section in the index that specifies the search algorithm used to create the embedding space.

   ```json
    "vectorSearch": {
        "algorithmConfigurations": [
            {
                "name": "vectorConfig",
                "kind": "hnsw",
                "hnswParameters": {
                    "m": 4,
                    "efConstruction": 400,
                    "efSearch": 500,
                    "metric": "cosine"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
   ```

   **Key points**:

   + Name of the configuration. The name must be unique within the index.
   + `hnsw` is the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm used to create the proximity graph during indexing. Only Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is supported in this API version. 
   + `m` (bi-directional link count) default is 4. The range is 4 to 10. Lower values should return less noise in the results. 
   + `efConstruction` default is 400. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing.
   + `efSearch` default is 500. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during search.
   + `metric` should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric associated with the embedding model you're using. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`.

## Add a vector field to the fields collection

The fields collection must include a field for the document key, vector fields, and any other fields that you need for hybrid search scenarios.

Vector fields are of type `Collection(Edm.Single)` and single-precision floating-point values. A field of this type also has a `dimensions` property and specifies a vector configuration.

### [**2023-11-01**](#tab/rest-2023-11-01)

Use this version if you want generally available features only.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) to create the index.

1. Define a vector field with the following attributes. You can store one generated embedding per field. For each vector field:

   + `type` must be `Collection(Edm.Single)`.
   + `dimensions` is the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model. For text-embedding-ada-002, it's 1536.
   + `vectorSearchProfile` is the name of a profile defined elsewhere in the index.
   + `searchable` must be true.
   + `retrievable` can be true or false. True returns the raw vectors (1536 of them) as plain text and consumes storage space. Set to true if you're passing a vector result to a downstream app.
   + `filterable`, `facetable`, `sortable` must be false. 

1. Add filterable non-vector fields to the collection, such as "title" with `filterable` set to true, if you want to invoke [prefiltering or postfiltering](vector-search-filters.md) on the [vector query](vector-search-how-to-query.md).

1. Add other fields that define the substance and structure of the textual content you're indexing. At a minimum, you need a document key. 

   You should also add fields that are useful in the query or in its response. The following example shows vector fields for title and content ("titleVector", "contentVector") that are equivalent to vectors. It also provides fields for equivalent textual content ("title", "content") useful for sorting, filtering, and reading in a search result.

   The following example shows the fields collection:

    ```http
    PUT https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index?api-version=2023-11-01&allowIndexDowntime=true

                "dimensions": 1536,
                "vectorSearchProfile": "my-default-vector-profile"
            }
        ],
        "vectorSearch": {
            "algorithms": [

                    }
                }
            ],

                    "algorithm": "my-hnsw-config-1"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

### [**2023-10-01-Preview**](#tab/rest-2023-10-01-Preview)

In the following REST API example, "title" and "content" contain textual content used in full text search and semantic ranking, while "titleVector" and "contentVector" contain vector data.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) to create the index.

1. Add vector fields to the fields collection. You can store one generated embedding per document field. For each vector field:

   + `type` must be `Collection(Edm.Single)`.
   + `dimensions` is the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model. For text-embedding-ada-002, it's 1536.
   + `vectorSearchProfile` is the name of a profile defined elsewhere in the index.
   + `searchable` must be true.

### [**2023-07-01-Preview**](#tab/rest-add-field)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The vector field definitions for this version are obsolete in later versions. We recommend migrating to **2023-11-01** or **2023-10-01-Preview**. Change `vectorSearchConfiguration` to `vectorSearchProfile`.

REST API version [**2023-07-01-Preview**](/rest/api/searchservice/index-preview) was the first REST API version to support vector scenarios. 

In the following REST API example, "title" and "content" contain textual content used in full text search and semantic ranking, while "titleVector" and "contentVector" contain vector data.

1. Use the [Create or Update Index Preview REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/create-or-update-index) to create the index.

1. Add vector fields to the fields collection. You can store one generated embedding per document field. For each vector field:

   + Assign the `Collection(Edm.Single)` data type.
   + Provide the name of the vector search algorithm configuration.
   + Provide the number of dimensions generated by the embedding model.
   + Set attributes:
     + "searchable" must be "true".
     + "retrievable" set to "true" allows you to display the raw vectors (for example, as a verification step), but doing so increases storage. Set to "false" if you don't need to return raw vectors. You don't need to return vectors for a query, but if you're passing a vector result to a downstream app then set "retrievable" to "true".
     + "filterable", "facetable", "sortable" attributes must be "false". Don't set them to "true" because those behaviors don't apply within the context of vector fields and the request will fail.

1. Add other fields that define the substance and structure of the textual content you're indexing. At a minimum, you need a document key. 

   You should also add fields that are useful in the query or in its response. The following example shows vector fields for title and content ("titleVector", "contentVector") that are equivalent to vectors. It also provides fields for equivalent textual content ("title", "content") useful for sorting, filtering, and reading in a search result.

   An index definition with the described elements looks like this:

    ```http
    PUT https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index?api-version=2023-07-01-Preview&allowIndexDowntime=true

            },
            {

            }
        ],
        "vectorSearch": {
            "algorithmConfigurations": [
                {
                    "name": "vectorConfig",
                    "kind": "hnsw",
                    "hnswParameters": {
                        "m": 4,
                        "efConstruction": 400,
                        "efSearch": 500,
                        "metric": "cosine"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal-add-field)

Azure portal supports **2023-10-01-Preview** behaviors.

Use the index designer in the Azure portal to add vector field definitions. If the index doesn't have a vector configuration, you're prompted to create one when you add your first vector field to the index.

Although you can add a field to an index, there's no portal (Import data wizard) support for loading it with vector data. Instead, use the REST APIs or an SDK for data import.

1. [Sign in to Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open your search service page in a browser.

1. In the left-side navigation pane, select **Search management** > **Indexes**.

1. Select **+ Add Index** and give the index a name.

1. Select **Add Field**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/vector-search-how-to-create-index/portal-add-field.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add Field pane." border="true":::

   **Key points**:

   + Name the field (no spaces).
   + Choose type `Collection(Edm.Single)`.
   + Select "Retrievable" if you want the query to return the vector data in search results. If you have other fields with human readable content that you can return as a proxy for the match, you should set "Retrievable" to false to save space.
   + "Searchable" is mandatory for a vector field and can't be changed.
   + "Dimensions" is the length of the vector returned by the model. Set this value to specify `1536` for **text-embeddding-ada-002**, where the input text that you provide is numerically described using 1536 dimensions.

1. Select or create a vector configuration used for similarity search. If the index doesn't have a vector configuration, you must select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/vector-search-how-to-create-index/portal-add-vector-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the vector configuration properties." border="true":::

   **Key points**:

   + Name the configuration. The name must be unique within the index.
   + "hnsw" is the Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) algorithm used to create the proximity graph during indexing. Currently, only Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is supported. 
   + "Bi-directional link count" default is 4. The range is 4 to 10. Lower values should return less noise in the results. 
   + "efConstruction" default is 400. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during indexing.
   + "efSearch default is 500. The range is 100 to 1,000. It's the number of nearest neighbors used during search.
   + "Similarity metric" should be "cosine" if you're using Azure OpenAI, otherwise use the similarity metric associated with the embedding model you're using. Supported values are `cosine`, `dotProduct`, `euclidean`.

   If you're familiar with HNSW parameters, you might be wondering about how to set the `"k"` number of nearest neighbors to return in the result. In Azure AI Search, that value is set on the [query request](vector-search-how-to-query.md).

1. Select **Save** to save the vector configuration and the field definition.

### [**.NET**](#tab/dotnet-add-field)

+ Use the [**Azure.Search.Documents**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.Search.Documents) package for vector scenarios. 

+ See the [azure-search-vector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-dotnet) GitHub repository for .NET code samples.

### [**Python**](#tab/python-add-field)

+ Use the [**Azure.Search.Documents 11.4.0b8**](https://pypi.org/project/azure-search-documents/11.4.0b8/) package for vector scenarios. 

+ See the [azure-search-vector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python) GitHub repository for Python code samples.

### [**JavaScript**](#tab/js-add-field)

+ Use the [**@azure/search-documents 12.0.0-beta.2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/search-documents/v/12.0.0-beta.2) package for vector scenarios.  

+ See the [azure-search-vector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-javascript) GitHub repository for JavaScript code samples.

## Load vector data for indexing

Content that you provide for indexing must conform to the index schema and include a unique string value for the document key. Pre-vectorized data is loaded into one or more vector fields, which can coexist with other fields containing alphanumeric content.

You can use either [push or pull methodologies](search-what-is-data-import.md) for data ingestion. 

### [**Push APIs**](#tab/push)

Use [Index Documents (2023-11-01)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/index), [Index Documents (2023-10-01-Preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true), or the [Add, Update, or Delete Documents (2023-07-01-Preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/preview-api/add-update-delete-documents) to push documents containing vector data.

        . . .
    ]
}
```

### [**Pull APIs (indexers)**](#tab/pull)

Indexers can retrieve and index vector fields in source documents, assuming an index schema that meets vector field requirements and the preview REST API.

Data sources provide the vectors in whatever format the data source supports (such as strings in JSON). The indexer assumes that fields typed as `Collection(Edm.Single)` contain vectors and will index that content as vector indexes.

+ No changes to field mapping behavior or change detection for vectors. The behaviors for text indexing also apply to vectors.

+ If vector data is sourced in files, we recommend a nondefault `parsingMode` such as `json`, `jsonLines`, or `csv` based on the shape of the data. 

+ For data sources, [Azure blob indexers](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) and [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL indexers](search-howto-index-cosmosdb.md) with one of the above mention parsingModes have been tested and confirmed to work. 

  Azure SQL doesn't provide a way to store a collection natively as a single SQL column. A workaround hasn't been identified at this time.

+ The dimensions of all vectors from the data source must be the same and match their index definition for the field they're mapping to. The indexer throws an error on any documents that don’t match.

---

## Check your index for vector content

For validation purposes, you can query the index using Search Explorer in Azure portal or a REST API call. Because Azure AI Search can't convert a vector to human-readable text, try to return fields from the same document that provide evidence of the match. For example, if the vector query targets the "titleVector" field, you could select "title" for the search results.

Fields must be attributed as "retrievable" to be included in the results.

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/portal-check-index)

You can use [Search Explorer](search-explorer.md) to query an index. Search explorer has two views: Query view (default) and JSON view. 

+ [Use the JSON view for vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md), pasting in a JSON definition of the vector query you want to execute.

+ Use the default Query view for a quick confirmation that the index contains vectors. The query view is for full text search. Although you can't use it for vector queries, you can send an empty search (`search=*`) to check for content. The content of all fields, including vector fields, is returned as plain text.

### [**REST API**](#tab/rest-check-index)

The following REST API example is a vector query, but it returns only non-vector fields (title, content, category). Only fields marked as "retrievable" can be returned in search results.

```http
POST https://my-search-service.search.windows.net/indexes/my-index/docs/search?api-version=2023-11-01
Content-Type: application/json
api-key: {{admin-api-key}}
{
    "vector": {
        "value": [
            -0.009154141,
            0.018708462,
            . . . 
            -0.02178128,
            -0.00086512347
        ],
        "fields": "contentVector",
        "k": 5
    },
    "select": "title, content, category"
}
```

---

## Update a vector store

To update a vector store, modify the schema and if necessary, reload documents to populate new fields. APIs for schema updates include [Create or Update Index (REST)](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update), [CreateOrUpdateIndex](/dotnet/api/azure.search.documents.indexes.searchindexclient.createorupdateindexasync) in the Azure SDK for .NET, [create_or_update_index](/python/api/azure-search-documents/azure.search.documents.indexes.searchindexclient?view=azure-python#azure-search-documents-indexes-searchindexclient-create-or-update-index&preserve-view=true) in the Azure SDK for Python, and similar methods in other Azure SDKs.

The standard guidance for updating an index is covered in [Drop and rebuild an index](search-howto-reindex.md). 

Key points include:

+ Drop and rebuild is often required for updates to and deletion of existing fields.

+ However, you can update an existing schema with the following modifications, with no rebuild required:

  + Add new fields to a fields collection.
  + Add new vector configurations, assigned to new fields but not existing fields that have already been vectorized.
  + Change "retrievable" (values are true or false) on an existing field. Vector fields must be searchable and retrievable, but if you want to disable access to a vector field in situations where drop and rebuild isn't feasible, you can set retrievable to false.

## Next steps

As a next step, we recommend [Query vector data in a search index](vector-search-how-to-query.md). 

Code samples in the [azure-search-vector](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples) repository demonstrate end-to-end workflows that include schema definition, vectorization, indexing, and queries.

There's demo code for [Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python), [C#](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-dotnet), and [JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-javascript).
