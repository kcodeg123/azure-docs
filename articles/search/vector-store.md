# Vector storage in Azure AI Search

Azure AI Search provides vector storage and configurations for [vector search](vector-search-overview.md) and [hybrid queries](hybrid-search-overview.md). Support is implemented at the field level, which means you can combine vector and nonvector fields in the same search corpus.

Vectors are stored in a search index. Use the [Create Index REST API](/rest/api/searchservice/indexes/create-or-update) or an equivalent Azure SDK method to [create the vector store](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md).

Considerations for vector storage include the following points:

+ Schema design to fit your use case.
+ Index sizing and search service capacity.
+ Vector data ingestion: loading, chunking, and embedding.
+ Vector data retrieval from an index is always through the query APIs. Your intended user experience determines whether query results are passed directly to a client app for rendering, or goes through an orchestration layer for generative AI.

## Vector retrieval patterns

In Azure AI Search, there are two patterns for working with search results. 

+ Generative search. Language models formulate a response to the user's query using data from Azure AI Search. This pattern usually includes an orchestration layer to coordinate prompts and maintain context. In this pattern, results are fed into prompt flows and chat models like GPT and Text-Davinci. This approach is based on [**Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**](retrieval-augmented-generation-overview.md) architecture, where the search index provides the grounding data.

+ Classic search. The search engine formulates a response based on content in your index, and you render those results in a client app. In a direct response from the search engine, results are returned in a flattened row set, and you can choose which fields are passed to the client app. It's expected that you would populate the vector store (search index) with nonvector content that's human readable so that you don't have to decode vectors for your response. The search engine matches on vectors, but returns nonvector values from the same search document.

Your index schema should reflect your primary use case.

## Schema designs for each retrieval pattern

The following examples highlight the differences in field composition for solutions build for generative AI versus classic search.

An index schema for a vector store requires a name, a key field, one or more vector fields, and a vector configuration. Nonvector fields are recommended for hybrid queries, or for returning human readable content that doesn't have to be decoded first. For step by step instructions, see [Create a vector store](vector-search-how-to-create-index.md).

### Basic vector field configuration

A vector field, such as "content_vector" in the following example, is of type `Collection(Edm.Single)`. It must be searchable and retrievable. It can't be filterable, facetable, or sortable, and it can't have analyzers, normalizers, or synonym map assignments. It must have dimensions set to a value supported by the embedding model. Text-embedding-ada-002 is the mostly commonly used embedding model and it generates embeddings using 1,536 dimensions. A vector search profile is specified in a vector search configuration and assigned to a vector field using the profile name.

Content (nonvector) fields are useful for human readable text returned directly from the search engine. If you're using language models exclusively for response formulation, you can skip nonvector content fields. This example assumes that "content" is the human readable equivalent of the "content_vector" field.

Metadata fields are useful for filters, especially if metadata includes origin information about the source document. 

```json
"name": "example-index-basic-vector-field",
"fields": [
  { "name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": false, "filterable": true, "retrievable": true, "key": true },
  { "name": "content_vector", "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "retrievable": true,
    "dimensions": 1536, "vectorSearchProfile": null },
  { "name": "content", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true, "analyzer": null },
  { "name": "metadata", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "retrievable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true }
]
```

### Schema generated by the Import and vectorize data wizard

We recommend the [Import and vectorize data wizard](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) for evaluation and proof-of-concept testing. The wizard generates the example schema in this section.

The bias of this schema is that search documents are built around data chunks. If a language model formulates the response, you want a schema designed around data chunks. 

Data chunking is necessary for staying within the input limits of language models, but it also improves precision in similarity search when queries can be matched against smaller chunks of content pulled from multiple parent documents. Finally, if you're using semantic ranking, the semantic ranker also has token limits, which are more easily met if data chunking is part of your approach.

In the following example, for each search document, there's one chunk ID, chunk, title, and vector field. The chunkID and parent ID are populated by the wizard, using base 64 encoding of blob metadata (path). Chunk and title are derived from blob content and blob name. Only the vector field is fully generated. It calls an Azure OpenAI resource that you provide.

```json
"name": "example-index-from-import-wizard",
"fields": [
  {"name": "chunk_id",  "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "retrievable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true, "analyzer": "keyword"},
  { "name": "parent_id", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "retrievable": true, "sortable": true},
  { "name": "chunk", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": false, "retrievable": true, "sortable": false},
  { "name": "title", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "retrievable": true, "sortable": false},
  { "name": "vector", "type": "Collection(Edm.Single)", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true, "dimensions": 1536, "vectorSearchProfile": "vector-1707768500058-profile"}
]
```

## Vector data retrieval

The vector search algorithms specify the navigation structures used at query time. The structures are created during indexing, but used during queries.

The content of your vector fields is determined by the [embedding step](vector-search-how-to-generate-embeddings.md) that vectorizes or encodes your content. If you use the same embedding model for all of your fields, you can [build vector queries](vector-search-how-to-query.md) that cover all of them. 

If you use search results as grounding data, where a chat model generates the answer to a query, design a schema that stores chunks of text. Data chunking is a requirement if source files are too large for the embedding model. It's also efficient for chat if the original source files contain a varied information.
