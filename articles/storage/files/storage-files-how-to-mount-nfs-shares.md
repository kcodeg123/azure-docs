# Mount NFS Azure file share on Linux

Azure file shares can be mounted in Linux distributions using either the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol or the Network File System (NFS) protocol. This article is focused on mounting with NFS. For details on mounting SMB Azure file shares, see [Use Azure Files with Linux](storage-how-to-use-files-linux.md). For details on each of the available protocols, see [Azure file share protocols](storage-files-planning.md#available-protocols).

## Applies to

| File share type | SMB | NFS |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) |

## Support

[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-limitations](../../../includes/files-nfs-limitations.md)]

### Regional availability

[!INCLUDE [files-nfs-regional-availability](../../../includes/files-nfs-regional-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

- [Create an NFS share](storage-files-how-to-create-nfs-shares.md).
- Open port 2049 on the client you want to mount your NFS share to.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > NFS shares can only be accessed from trusted networks.

- Either [create a private endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#create-a-private-endpoint) (recommended) or [restrict access to your public endpoint](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#restrict-public-endpoint-access).
- To enable hybrid access to an NFS Azure file share, use one of the following networking solutions:
    - [Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN on Linux for use with Azure Files](storage-files-configure-p2s-vpn-linux.md).
    - [Configure a Site-to-Site VPN for use with Azure Files](storage-files-configure-s2s-vpn.md).
    - Configure [ExpressRoute](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

## Disable secure transfer

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and access the storage account containing the NFS share you created.
1. Select **Configuration**.
1. Select **Disabled** for **Secure transfer required**.
1. Select **Save**.

## Mount options

The following mount options are recommended or required when mounting NFS Azure file shares.

| **Mount option** | **Recommended value** | **Description** |
|******************|***********************|*****************|
| `vers` | 4 | Required. Specifies which version of the NFS protocol to use. Azure Files only supports NFS v4.1. |
| `minorversion` | 1 | Required. Specifies the minor version of the NFS protocol. Some Linux distros don't recognize minor versions on the `vers` parameter. So instead of `vers=4.1`, use `vers=4,minorversion=1`. |
| `sec` | sys | Required. Specifies the type of security to use when authenticating an NFS connection. Setting `sec=sys` uses the local UNIX UIDs and GIDs that use AUTH_SYS to authenticate NFS operations. |
| `rsize` | 1048576 | Recommended. Sets the maximum number of bytes to be transferred in a single NFS read operation. Specifying the maximum level of 1048576 bytes will usually result in the best performance. |
| `wsize` | 1048576 | Recommended. Sets the maximum number of bytes to be transferred in a single NFS write operation. Specifying the maximum level of 1048576 bytes will usually result in the best performance. |
| `noresvport` | n/a | Recommended. Tells the NFS client to use a non-privileged source port when communicating with an NFS server for the mount point. Using the `noresvport` mount option helps ensure that your NFS share has uninterrupted availability after a reconnection. Using this option is strongly recommended for achieving high availability. |
| `actimeo` | 30-60 | Recommended. Specifying `actimeo` sets all of `acregmin`, `acregmax`, `acdirmin`, and `acdirmax` to the same value. Using a value lower than 30 seconds can cause performance degradation because attribute caches for files and directories expire too quickly. We recommend setting `actimeo` between 30 and 60 seconds. |

## Mount an NFS share using the Azure portal

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `nconnect` Linux mount option to improve performance for NFS Azure file shares at scale. For more information, see [Improve NFS Azure file share performance](nfs-performance.md#nconnect).

1. Once the file share is created, select the share and select **Connect from Linux**.
1. Enter the mount path you'd like to use, then copy the script.
1. Connect to your client and use the provided mounting script. Only the required mount options are included in the script, but you can add other [recommended mount options](#mount-options).

    :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-how-to-create-mount-nfs-shares/mount-nfs-file-share-script.png" alt-text="Screenshot of file share connect blade.":::

You have now mounted your NFS share.

## Mount an NFS share using /etc/fstab

If you want the NFS file share to automatically mount every time the Linux server or VM boots, create a record in the **/etc/fstab** file for your Azure file share. Replace `YourStorageAccountName` and `FileShareName` with your information.

```bash
<YourStorageAccountName>.file.core.windows.net:/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> /media/<YourStorageAccountName>/<FileShareName> nfs vers=4,minorversion=1,sec=sys 0 0
```

For more information, enter the command `man fstab` from the Linux command line.

### Validate connectivity

If your mount failed, it's possible that your private endpoint wasn't set up correctly or isn't accessible. For details on confirming connectivity, see [Verify connectivity](storage-files-networking-endpoints.md#verify-connectivity).

## NFS file share snapshots

Customers using NFS Azure file shares can create, list, and delete NFS Azure file share snapshots. This capability allows users to roll back entire file systems or recover files that were accidentally deleted or corrupted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should mount your file share before creating snapshots. If you create a new NFS file share and take snapshots before mounting the share, attempting to list the snapshots for the share will return an empty list. We recommend deleting any snapshots taken before the first mount and re-creating them after you've mounted the share.

### Limitations

Only file management APIs (`AzRmStorageShare`) are supported for NFS Azure file share snapshots. File data plane APIs (`AzStorageShare`) aren't supported.

Azure Backup isn't currently supported for NFS file shares.

AzCopy isn't currently supported for NFS file shares. To copy data from an NFS Azure file share or share snapshot, use file system copy tools such as rsync or fpsync.

NFS Azure file share snapshots are available in all Azure public cloud regions.

### Create a snapshot

You can create a snapshot of an NFS Azure file share using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, or Azure CLI. A share can support the creation of up to 200 share snapshots.

### Mount an NFS Azure file share snapshot

To mount an NFS Azure file share snapshot to a Linux VM (NFS client) and restore files, follow these steps.

1. Run the following command in a console. See [Mount options](#mount-options) for other recommended mount options. To improve copy performance, mount the snapshot with [nconnect](nfs-performance.md#nconnect) to use multiple TCP channels.
   
   ```bash
   sudo mount -o vers=4,minorversion=1,proto=tcp,sec=sys $server:/nfs4account/share /media/nfs
   ```
   
1. Change the directory to `/media/nfs/.snapshots` so you can view the available snapshots. The `.snapshots` directory is hidden by default, but you can access and read from it like any directory.
   
   ```bash
   cd /media/nfs/.snapshots
   ```
   
1. List the contents of the `.snapshots` folder.
   
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   
1. Each snapshot has its own directory that serves as a recovery point. Change to the snapshot directory for which you want to restore files.
   
   ```bash
   cd <snapshot-name>
   ```
   
1. List the contents of the directory to view a list of files and directories that can be recovered.
   
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   
1. Copy all files and directories from the snapshot to a *restore* directory to complete the restore.
   
   ```bash
   cp -r <snapshot-name> ../restore
   ```
   
The files and directories from the snapshot should now be available in the `/media/nfs/restore` directory.
