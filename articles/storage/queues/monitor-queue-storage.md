<a name="collection-and-routing"></a>
### Azure Queue Storage diagnostic settings

When you create the diagnostic setting, choose **queue** as the type of storage that you want to enable logs for. Then, specify one of the following categories of operations for which you want to collect logs.

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| StorageRead | Read operations on objects. |
| StorageWrite | Write operations on objects. |
| StorageDelete | Delete operations on objects. |

The **audit** resource log category group allows you to collect the baseline of resource logs that Microsoft deems necessary for auditing your resource. What's collected is dynamic, and Microsoft may change it over time as new resource log categories become available. If you choose the **audit** category group, you can't specify any other resource categories, because the system will decide which logs to collect. For more information, see [Diagnostic settings in Azure Monitor: Resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#resource-logs).

#### Destination limitations

For general destination limitations, see [Destination limitations](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings#destination-limitations). The following limitations apply only to monitoring Azure Storage accounts.

- You can't send logs to the same storage account that you're monitoring with this setting. This situation would lead to recursive logs in which a log entry describes the writing of another log entry. You must create an account or use another existing account to store log information.

- You can't set a retention policy. 

  If you archive logs to a storage account, you can manage the retention policy of a log container by defining a lifecycle management policy. To learn how, see [Optimize costs by automatically managing the data lifecycle](../blobs/lifecycle-management-overview.md).

  If you send logs to Log Analytics, you can manage the data retention period of Log Analytics at the workspace level or even specify different retention settings by data type. To learn how, see [Change the data retention period](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-retention-archive).

<!-- ## Activity log. Required section. Optionally, add service-specific information about your activity log after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-activity-log](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-activity-log.md)]
<!-- Activity log service-specific information. Add service-specific information about your activity log here. -->

<!-- ## Imported logs. Optional section. If your service uses imported logs, add the following include and information. 
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-imported-logs](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-imported-logs.md)]
<!-- Add service-specific information about your imported logs here. -->

<!-- ## Other logs. Optional section.
If your service has other logs that aren't resource logs or in the activity log, add information that states what they are and what they cover here. You can describe how to route them in a later section. -->

### Analyze metrics for Azure Queue Storage

Metrics for Azure Queue Storage are in these namespaces:

- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
- Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/queueServices

For a list of all Azure Monitor supported metrics, which includes Azure Queue Storage, see [Azure Monitor supported metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

You can analyze metrics for Azure Storage with metrics from other Azure services by using Metrics Explorer. Open Metrics Explorer by choosing **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. For details on using this tool, see [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/analyze-metrics).

This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-queue-storage/access-metrics-portal.png)

For metrics that support dimensions, you can filter the metric with the desired dimension value. This example shows how to view **Transactions** at the account level on a specific operation by selecting values for the **API Name** dimension.

![Screenshot of accessing metrics with dimension in the Azure portal](./media/monitor-queue-storage/access-metrics-portal-with-dimension.png)

For a complete list of the dimensions that Azure Storage supports, see [Metrics dimensions](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md#metrics-dimensions).

### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

#### List the metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetricDefinition](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetricdefinition) cmdlet.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetricDefinition -ResourceId $resourceId
```

#### Read metric values

You can read account-level metric values of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [Get-AzMetric](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azmetric) cmdlet.

```powershell
   $resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
   Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricNames "UsedCapacity" -TimeGrain 01:00:00
```

#### Read metric values with dimensions

When a metric supports dimensions, you can read metric values and filter them by using dimension values. Use the [Get-AzMetric](/powershell/module/Az.Monitor/Get-AzMetric) cmdlet.

```powershell
$resourceId = "<resource-ID>"
$dimFilter = [String](New-AzMetricFilter -Dimension ApiName -Operator eq -Value "GetMessages" 3> $null)
Get-AzMetric -ResourceId $resourceId -MetricName Transactions -TimeGrain 01:00:00 -MetricFilter $dimFilter -AggregationType "Total"
```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

#### List the account-level metric definition

You can list the metric definition of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [`az monitor metrics list-definitions`](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list-definitions) command.

In this example, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the resource ID of the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list-definitions --resource <resource-ID>
```

#### Read account-level metric values

You can read the metric values of your storage account or the Queue Storage service. Use the [`az monitor metrics list`](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) command.

```azurecli-interactive
   az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "UsedCapacity" --interval PT1H
```

#### Read metric values with dimensions

When a metric supports dimensions, you can read metric values and filter them by using dimension values. Use the [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#az-monitor-metrics-list) command.

```azurecli
az monitor metrics list --resource <resource-ID> --metric "Transactions" --interval PT1H --filter "ApiName eq 'GetMessages' " --aggregation "Total" 
```

### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

Azure Monitor provides the [.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.azure.management.monitor/) to read metric definition and values. The [sample code](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/samples/monitor-dotnet-metrics-api/) shows how to use the SDK with different parameters. You need to use `0.18.0-preview` or a later version for storage metrics.

In these examples, replace the `<resource-ID>` placeholder with the resource ID of the entire storage account or the queue. You can find these resource IDs on the **Properties** pages of your storage account in the Azure portal.

Replace the `<subscription-ID>` variable with the ID of your subscription. For guidance on how to obtain values for `<tenant-ID>`, `<application-ID>`, and `<AccessKey>`, see [Use the portal to create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](../../active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal.md).

#### List the account-level metric definition

The following example shows how to list a metric definition at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ListStorageMetricDefinition()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;
        IEnumerable<MetricDefinition> metricDefinitions = await readOnlyClient.MetricDefinitions.ListAsync(resourceUri: resourceId, cancellationToken: new CancellationToken());

        foreach (var metricDefinition in metricDefinitions)
        {
            // Enumrate metric definition:
            //    Id
            //    ResourceId
            //    Name
            //    Unit
            //    MetricAvailabilities
            //    PrimaryAggregationType
            //    Dimensions
            //    IsDimensionRequired
        }
    }

```

#### Read account-level metric values

The following example shows how to read `UsedCapacity` data at the account level:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValue()
    {
        var resourceId = "<resource-ID>";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID>";
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;

        Response = await readOnlyClient.Metrics.ListAsync(
            resourceUri: resourceId,
            timespan: timeSpan,
            interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
            metricnames: "UsedCapacity",

            aggregation: "Average",
            resultType: ResultType.Data,
            cancellationToken: CancellationToken.None);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            // Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

#### Read multidimensional metric values

For multidimensional metrics, you need to define metadata filters if you want to read metric data on specific dimension values.

The following example shows how to read metric data on the metric supporting multidimension:

```csharp
    public static async Task ReadStorageMetricValueTest()
    {
        // Resource ID for queue storage
        var resourceId = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{storageAccountName}/queueServices/default";
        var subscriptionId = "<subscription-ID}";
        // How to identify Tenant ID, Application ID and Access Key: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/
        var tenantId = "<tenant-ID>";
        var applicationId = "<application-ID>";
        var accessKey = "<AccessKey>";

        MonitorManagementClient readOnlyClient = AuthenticateWithReadOnlyClient(tenantId, applicationId, accessKey, subscriptionId).Result;

        Microsoft.Azure.Management.Monitor.Models.Response Response;

        string startDate = DateTime.Now.AddHours(-3).ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string endDate = DateTime.Now.ToUniversalTime().ToString("o");
        string timeSpan = startDate + "/" + endDate;
        // It's applicable to define meta data filter when a metric support dimension
        // More conditions can be added with the 'or' and 'and' operators, example: BlobType eq 'BlockBlob' or BlobType eq 'PageBlob'
        ODataQuery<MetadataValue> odataFilterMetrics = new ODataQuery<MetadataValue>(
            string.Format("BlobType eq '{0}'", "BlockBlob"));

        Response = readOnlyClient.Metrics.List(
                        resourceUri: resourceId,
                        timespan: timeSpan,
                        interval: System.TimeSpan.FromHours(1),
                        metricnames: "BlobCapacity",
                        odataQuery: odataFilterMetrics,
                        aggregation: "Average",
                        resultType: ResultType.Data);

        foreach (var metric in Response.Value)
        {
            //Enumrate metric value
            //    Id
            //    Name
            //    Type
            //    Unit
            //    Timeseries
            //        - Data
            //        - Metadatavalues
        }
    }

```

### Analyze logs for Azure Queue Storage

You can access resource logs either as a blob in a storage account, as event data, or through Log Analytics queries. For information about how to find those logs, see [Azure resource logs](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs).

To get the list of SMB and REST operations that are logged, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages).

Log entries are created only if there are requests made against the service endpoint. For example, if a storage account has activity in its queue endpoint but not in its table or blob endpoints, only logs that pertain to Queue Storage are created. Azure Storage logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.

When you view a storage account in the Azure portal, the operations called by the portal are also logged. For this reason, you may see operations logged in a storage account even though you haven't written any data to the account.

#### Log authenticated requests

 The following types of authenticated requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Failed requests, including time-out, throttling, network, authorization, and other errors
- Requests that use a shared access signature (SAS) or OAuth, including failed and successful requests
- Requests to analytics data (classic log data in the **$logs** container and class metric data in the **$metric** tables)

Requests made by the Queue Storage service itself, such as log creation or deletion, aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages) and [Storage log format](monitor-queue-storage-reference.md).

#### Log anonymous requests

 The following types of anonymous requests are logged:

- Successful requests
- Server errors
- Time out errors for both client and server
- Failed GET requests with the error code 304 (`Not Modified`)

<!-- ### Sample Kusto queries. Required section. If you have sample Kusto queries for your service, add them after the include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/articles/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]
<!-- Add sample Kusto queries for your service here. -->
Here are some queries that you can enter in the **Log search** bar to help you monitor your Queue Storage. These queries work with the [new language](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview.md). For more information, see [Log Analytics tutorial](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial).

- To list the 10 most common errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by StatusText
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations that caused the most errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText !contains "Success"
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | top 10 by count_ desc
    ```

- To list the top 10 operations with the longest end-to-end latency over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | top 10 by DurationMs desc
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, DurationMs, ServerLatencyMs, ClientLatencyMs = DurationMs - ServerLatencyMs
    ```

- To list all operations that caused server-side throttling errors over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and StatusText contains "ServerBusy"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, StatusCode, StatusText
    ```

- To list all requests with anonymous access over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageBlobLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d) and AuthenticationType == "Anonymous"
    | project TimeGenerated, OperationName, AuthenticationType, Uri
    ```

- To create a pie chart of operations used over the last three days.

    ```kusto
    StorageQueueLogs
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(3d)
    | summarize count() by OperationName
    | sort by count_ desc
    | render piechart
    ```
